# COSURVIVAL Case Studies Index

> *Real-world case studies integrated across the curriculum*

## Overview

This index provides a comprehensive overview of all case studies integrated into the COSURVIVAL system. Each case study demonstrates real-world applications of COSURVIVAL principles and provides learners with practical examples.

## Case Studies

### 1. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Cybersecurity Gamble

**Focus:** Security as business risk, not IT problem

**Key Lessons:**
- Security is not optional—foundational controls are required
- Security is a business risk, not an IT problem
- Reactive security fails—governance must be proactive
- Funding doesn't fix governance—structural issues require structural solutions
- Trust is strategic—security weaknesses undermine confidence

**Integration Points:**
- Week 10: Real-World Case Study section + Activity 10.6
- Security Trust Fabric: JLR analysis section
- Problem Set 9: 4 problems analyzing JLR failures
- Supporting Materials: Rubrics, instructor guide, timeline, cost-benefit template

**Files:**
- Analysis: `curriculum/core/TEACHER_WEEK10.md` (Case Study section)
- Integration Summary: `JLR_CASE_STUDY_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md`
- Improvements: `JLR_CASE_STUDY_IMPROVEMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`

**Status:** ✅ Complete

### 2. OpenAI A-SWE (Agentic Software Engineer)

**Focus:** AI as advisor, not authority; Security as supply chain problem

**Key Lessons:**
- AI as advisor, not authority (A-SWE replaces; COSURVIVAL guides)
- Security as supply chain problem (AI-generated code requires governance)
- Learning vs. dependency (SSM preserves learning; A-SWE risks skill loss)
- Trust Fabric requirements (AI code needs same trust standards + additional checks)
- Human-in-the-loop essential (All AI-generated code requires human review)

**Integration Points:**
- Week AI: Case study section
- Week 10: AI-Generated Code Security section
- Week 0: Governance gate for AI code
- Security Trust Fabric: Threat category #6
- Problem Set 10: 3 problems
- Core System: Advisor, governance, vision documents

**Files:**
- Analysis: `curriculum/case_studies/A_SWE_ANALYSIS.md`
- Integration Summary: `A_SWE_SYSTEM_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md`

**Status:** ✅ Complete

- Connect to curriculum concepts
- Facilitate discussions using provided questions
- Use rubrics for assessment

### For Learners
- Read case studies before relevant weeks
- Complete problem sets
- Reflect on discussion questions
- Apply lessons to your own context

### For Developers
- Reference case studies when implementing features
- Use as examples of COSURVIVAL principles
- Learn from real-world failures
- Apply lessons to system design

## Key Insights Across Case Studies

### Common Themes
1. **Governance First:** Both JLR and A-SWE demonstrate failures when governance is ignored
2. **Security as Business Risk:** Security failures have business consequences
3. **Proactive vs. Reactive:** Proactive governance prevents catastrophic failures
4. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Human oversight essential (security reviews, AI code review)
5. **Trust as Supply Chain:** Trust requires code, data, identity, and human integrity

### COSURVIVAL Principles Demonstrated
- Governance gate prevents issues
- Security by design, not bolt-on
- AI as advisor, not authority
- Learning preserved, not replaced
- Trust as supply chain problem
