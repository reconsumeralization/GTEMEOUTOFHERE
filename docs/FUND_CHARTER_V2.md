# Mutually Assured Success Fund Charter v2 (TEACHER-Anchored)

**Purpose**  
Advance humanity’s enduring safety, prosperity, education, and spiritual dignity across all regions and generations through three aligned lanes:

1) **TEACHER First Principle (Permanent Foundation)**  
   A protected, non-negotiable portion funds development, security, research, operations, and distribution of TEACHER as a lifelong learning companion for everyone with internet access. TEACHER remains the permanent engine of universal benefit: intergenerational learning, ethical AI, family resilience, and shared prosperity.

2) **Humanitarian & Child Protection**  
   Programs that protect children, fight exploitation, build resilient families, expand ethical education access, and strengthen local communities.

3) **Lawful Political Support (Separated & Transparent)**  
   Political support, when pursued, is conducted only via lawful, transparent channels and must never compromise TEACHER’s universal mission or humanitarian integrity.

## Non-Negotiable Allocation Rule
- **Floor:** At least 50% of all net funds (after essential admin) must be allocated to TEACHER until TEACHER reaches sustainable self-funding at scale.  
- **Perpetual Endowment:** After self-funding is achieved, a **minimum 25% perpetual allocation** remains locked for TEACHER forever.  
- **No Borrowing:** Political or humanitarian lanes cannot draw down the TEACHER floor. Changes to the floor require a supermajority Board vote, public notice, and a 90-day comment period.

---

## Lane Separation & Controls
- Separate accounts, approvals, and communications for each lane.  
- Political lane follows jurisdictional compliance, no dark money, and may not influence marketplace ranking or TEACHER access.  
- Geo-risk review: no political spend that endangers TEACHER’s neutrality or distribution in any region.

---

## Transparency Standard
Every major disbursement includes: **Amount | Recipient | Lane (TEACHER / Human Good / Political) | Justification | Expected Outcomes.**  
Annual public report: plain-language summary of allocations, impacts, and variances vs. plan. Independent audits cover all lanes.

---

## Governance & Decision Rights
- **TEACHER allocation:** CTO/Head of Product + Head of Trust & Safety + CFO; Safety/Privacy veto applies.  
- **Humanitarian:** Program lead + Safety; Privacy review when data flows are present.  
- **Political:** General Counsel + Compliance + Safety review; Board approval above defined thresholds; cannot proceed if it harms TEACHER neutrality.  
- **Conflict handling:** If lanes conflict, TEACHER and Safety/Child Protection take precedence. Escalate to Board within 48 hours.  
- **Change control:** TEACHER floor changes require supermajority + public notice; no emergency override.

## Resource-Adjusted Equity
**Resource-Adjusted Equity Principle**  
The fund and TEACHER deployment must account for real-world resource differences (connectivity, device access, educator availability, language/culture, safety risk, economic capacity, regulatory feasibility). Target equal outcomes of access and benefit—not identical inputs.

**Operational Rule**  
Funding and rollout priority follow a Resource & Access Index (RAI) that scores regions on connectivity, devices, education capacity, language/culture coverage, safety risk (exploitation/trafficking/conflict), economic constraints, and regulatory feasibility. Higher-need, lower-resource environments receive higher per-capita support and simplified delivery modes.

**Allocation Basis**  
Distribution uses a combined model: Need Weight (education gaps, child protection urgency) + Resource Weight (RAI) + Impact Feasibility (deployable now vs. staged). Preserve capacity to build missing infrastructure when immediate deployment is constrained.

**TEACHER Delivery Tiers (must match local resources before scale-up)**  
- Tier 1: Full AI + rich content  
- Tier 2: Lite AI + cached curriculum  
- Tier 3: Offline-first + community mentor  
- Tier 4: Emergency learning + child safety modules  
No resource-oblivious deployment: pick the tier appropriate to local constraints before scaling.

**Product Adaptations (low resource awareness)**  
- Low-compute modes (text-first, cached lesson packs, local progress)  
- Low-bandwidth delivery (offline downloads, SMS/WhatsApp micro-lessons, audio-first)  
- Device-agnostic UI (older Android, lightweight web, kiosk mode)  
- Local co-teaching (train-the-trainer, community certification, TEACHER + human mentor)

**Drop-in clause**  
Resource-Adjusted Equity: The fund and TEACHER deployment will account for real-world constraints across regions—connectivity, device access, educator capacity, safety risks, and local economics. We prioritize equal outcomes of access and benefit, directing funds via the RAI toward the highest-need, lowest-resource communities, while phasing infrastructure, offline-first tiers, and local co-teaching to keep TEACHER usable, safe, and sustainable everywhere.

## Integration with Operations
- Budget systems enforce floors/caps; no reclassification to dilute TEACHER spend.  
- Segregated banking and bookkeeping; independent audits; variance >10% triggers Board review and public note.  
- Incentives: KPIs include safety, equity, privacy, and trust metrics—never political outcomes or engagement alone.  
- Transparency to staff: quarterly townhalls on spend by lane; celebrate de-risking wins, not just velocity.

## One-Sentence Mission (reusable)
**We fund TEACHER as humanity’s lifelong learning backbone, protect the vulnerable, and support lawful civic leadership—so all people, in all regions and ages, can prosper together for generations.**
