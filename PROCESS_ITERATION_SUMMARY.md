## Iteration 1: JLR Case Study (Learn by Doing)

### What We Did
- Created analysis document
- Integrated into Week 10
- Added problem sets
- Created supporting materials (rubrics, instructor guide)

### What We Learned
- Real-world case studies are powerful learning tools
- Supporting materials enhance usability
- Timeline and cost-benefit analysis add depth
- Cross-curriculum connections strengthen learning

### Process Gaps
- No systematic process
- Some areas missed (core system files)
- Cross-references added later
- Process not documented

### Output
- 4 integration areas
- 6 files modified
- 9 hours total (6 initial + 3 improvements)
- Improvement checklist created

## Iteration 2: A-SWE Case Study (Systematic Application)

### What We Did
- Applied systematic process (documented as we went)
- Integrated across 8 areas (vs. 4 for JLR)
- Added to core system files
- Created comprehensive cross-references

### What We Learned
- Systematic process ensures comprehensive integration
- Core system updates reinforce principles
- Cross-referencing strengthens connections
- Process documentation helps future integrations

### Process Improvements
- Documented process as we applied it
- More comprehensive integration
- Better cross-referencing
- Core system files included

### Output
- 8 integration areas
- 11 files modified
- 8 hours (more efficient with process)
- Process documentation created

## Iteration 3: Process Documentation (Formalization)

### What We Did
- Documented complete process
- Created templates and checklists
- Added time estimates
- Created quick reference guide
- Created case studies index

### What We Learned
- Documented process is reusable
- Templates speed up future integrations
- Quick reference enables fast application
- Index helps find related content

### Process Improvements
- Systematic 7-step process
- Clear time estimates
- Integration checklist
- Success criteria
- Templates for future use

### Output
- Process documentation
- Quick reference guide
- Case studies index
- Updated integration summaries

## Process Refinement Highlights

### From Iteration 1 to 2
- **Added:** Core system integration step
- **Improved:** Cross-referencing approach
- **Result:** More comprehensive integration

### From Iteration 2 to 3
- **Added:** Process documentation
- **Created:** Templates and checklists
- **Result:** Reusable, scalable process

## Process Principles Established

1. **Comprehensive Integration:** Don't just add to one place
2. **Consistency:** Use same terminology, structure, patterns
3. **Progressive Learning:** Build on previous weeks
4. **Practical Application:** Include code examples, exercises
5. **Cross-Referencing:** Link related content

## Future Iterations

### Planned Improvements
- Create case study template
- Automate cross-reference checking
- Create integration checklist generator
- Add visual diagrams automatically
- Create case study comparison tool

### Next Case Studies
- NHS cybersecurity failures
- Other UK organizations
- Industry-specific cases
