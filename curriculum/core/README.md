## Key Concepts

### The Three Lenses
- **TRIBE** - Who is connected to whom?
- **TEACHER** - What skills are being demonstrated?
- **RECON** - What value is being exchanged?

### Self-Relative Learning
- Never compare to peers
- Measure trajectory, not position
- Frame as growth opportunities

### Governance First
- PII handling
- Bias guardrails
- Prohibited inferences
- Triple Balance review
