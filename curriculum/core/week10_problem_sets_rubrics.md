# Week 10 Problem Set 9: Assessment Rubrics

> *Self-relative growth assessment for JLR Case Study problems*

## Assessment Philosophy

**Self-Relative Growth:**
- Compare to your Week 9 baseline, not to peers
- Focus on learning and improvement, not perfection
- Growth indicators show progress, not absolute skill level

**Not Evaluated:**
- Speed relative to peers
- "Correctness" of interpretations
- Complexity of implementation

**Evaluated:**
- Growth from Week 9 baseline
- Understanding of COSURVIVAL principles
- Quality of analysis and recommendations
- Ability to explain decisions

## Problem 9.3: Security as Business Risk

### Learning Outcome
Design systems that treat security as a business risk, not an IT problem.

### Rubric

| **Impact Calculation** | Basic impact estimates | Impact estimates with some metrics | Comprehensive impact calculation | Impact calculation with financial modeling |
| **Risk Reports** | Basic report structure | Report with some analysis | Comprehensive report with recommendations | Executive-ready report with actionable insights |

### Growth Indicators

**From Week 9 Baseline:**
- [ ] Can now assess security as business risk
- [ ] Can integrate security into business decisions
- [ ] Can calculate business impact of security failures
- [ ] Can create business-focused security reports

### Self-Assessment Questions

1. **How did your understanding of security as business risk change?**
2. **What business metrics did you use in your analysis?**
3. **How would you present this to business stakeholders?**
4. **What would you do differently in a real organization?**

## Problem 9.4: Proactive vs. Reactive Security

### Learning Outcome

### Rubric

| Criteria | Emerging (1) | Developing (2) | Proficient (3) | Exemplary (4) |
|----------|-------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Proactive Checks** | Basic proactive checks | Proactive checks with some validations | Comprehensive proactive security framework | Proactive framework with continuous monitoring |
| **Comparison Analysis** | Basic comparison | Comparison with some metrics | Comprehensive comparison with quantified benefits | Comparison with ROI analysis and recommendations |
| **Demonstration** | Basic demonstration | Demonstration with examples | Comprehensive demonstration with test cases | Demonstration with real-world scenarios |
| **Recommendations** | 1-2 basic recommendations | 3-4 recommendations | Comprehensive recommendations with priorities | Recommendations with implementation roadmap |

### Growth Indicators

## Instructor Notes

### Using These Rubrics

1. **Focus on Growth:** Use rubrics to show learners their progress, not to rank them
2. **Self-Assessment First:** Have learners self-assess before instructor feedback
3. **Specific Feedback:** Use rubric criteria to give specific, actionable feedback
4. **Celebrate Progress:** Acknowledge growth at any level, not just "Exemplary"

### Common Patterns

**Emerging → Developing:**
- Learners often identify failures but struggle with mapping to principles
- Focus on: Connecting failures to COSURVIVAL principles

**Developing → Proficient:**
- Learners map correctly but lack depth in analysis
- Focus on: Impact analysis and comprehensive recommendations

**Proficient → Exemplary:**
- Learners have good analysis but lack business context
- Focus on: Business metrics, ROI, executive communication

### Differentiation

**For Advanced Learners:**
- Extend to other case studies (NHS, etc.)
- Create security maturity models
- Design industry-specific frameworks

**For Learners Needing Support:**
- Provide more examples
- Break down problems into smaller steps
- Focus on one failure at a time

*"Security must be a business risk, not an IT problem. Foundational controls are required, not optional. Governance must be proactive, not reactive."*
