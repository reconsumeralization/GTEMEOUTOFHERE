# Week 0: Concepts

## Theme: "Making Data Alive"

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, learners will:
- Understand that the same data can mean different things in different contexts
- Recognize the three lenses: TRIBE (relationships), TEACHER (growth), RECON (value)
- Feel confident that they belong in this space

### Core Concepts

#### 1. Everything is 0s and 1s (but context creates meaning)

```
Same Row of Activity Data:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ UserA accessed Document.pdf shared by UserB at 10:30am  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         │
        ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
        ▼                ▼                ▼
    TRIBE LENS      TEACHER LENS     RECON LENS
    "UserA and      "UserA is        "The document
    UserB are       learning from    platform is
    connected"      UserB"           providing value"
```

##### Inspiration: Meaning Through Perspective

> *"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known."*
> 
> — 1 Corinthians 13:12

**Connection:** Just as we see truth partially now, we see data through different lenses. The same activity row means different things through TRIBE (relationships), TEACHER (growth), and RECON (value) perspectives. Understanding grows as we view from multiple angles.

> *"The same object casts different shadows depending on the light."*
> 
> — Plato's Allegory of the Cave

**Connection:** The same activity data means different things through TRIBE/TEACHER/RECON lenses. Just as prisoners in the cave see shadows and must learn to see the true forms, we see data through different perspectives to understand deeper truth.

> *"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."*
> 
> — Aristotle

**Connection:** The three lenses together (TRIBE + TEACHER + RECON) reveal more than any single lens alone. The whole system is greater than individual insights.

> *"I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free."*
> 
> — Michelangelo

**Connection:** The same raw data contains multiple meanings. We "carve" (analyze) through different lenses until we "set free" the insights hidden within.

##### Alternative Perspectives: How Other Thinkers Would View This Problem

**The Problem:** The same activity data can mean different things. How do we understand truth when context changes meaning?

**Plato's Approach (Forms & Shadows):**
> *"The same object casts different shadows depending on the light."*
> 
> — Allegory of the Cave

Plato would say: The shadows (TRIBE/TEACHER/RECON views) are not the truth itself, but they point to the Form (the underlying reality). We must move beyond the shadows to see the true Form—the complete understanding that synthesizes all three lenses.

**Aristotle's Approach (Empirical Observation):**
> *"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."*
> 
> — Aristotle

Aristotle would say: Don't choose one lens—use all three. Observe through TRIBE, then TEACHER, then RECON. The complete truth emerges from combining all perspectives. The whole (all three lenses together) reveals more than any single lens alone.

**Michelangelo's Approach (Revealing Hidden Beauty):**
> *"I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free."*
> 
> — Michelangelo

Michelangelo would say: The meaning isn't created—it's already there, waiting to be revealed. Each lens "carves away" the unnecessary to reveal a different aspect of the truth. All three carvings together reveal the complete "angel" (full understanding).

**Biblical Perspective (Progressive Revelation):**
> *"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known."*
> 
> — 1 Corinthians 13:12

The biblical view: We see partially now (through one lens), but understanding grows as we view from multiple angles. Complete knowledge comes from seeing "face to face"—integrating all three perspectives.

**Synthesis:** All four perspectives agree: truth requires multiple viewpoints. Plato seeks the Form beyond shadows, Aristotle combines observations, Michelangelo reveals hidden beauty, and the biblical view emphasizes progressive understanding. Together, they teach us that the three lenses (TRIBE/TEACHER/RECON) are not competing truths—they are complementary paths to complete understanding.

#### 2. The Three Questions

| Lens | Question | Output |
|------|----------|--------|
| **TRIBE** | Who is connected to whom? | Network graph |
| **TEACHER** | Who is growing in what ways? | Learning pathways |
| **RECON** | Who is providing value ethically? | Provider scores |

#### 3. Privileges = Skills (a key insight)

When someone gets permission to do something new, they're demonstrating readiness. Permission changes are skill acquisitions in disguise.

```
StateOld: "viewer" → StateNew: "editor"

TEACHER interpretation: This person has grown from 
consuming information to creating it.
```

### Activities

#### Activity 0.1: The Lens Toggle Simulator
**Time:** 15 minutes

Interactive exercise where learners view a single activity row and toggle between:
- 🌐 TRIBE view (highlights: who interacted with whom)
- 📚 TEACHER view (highlights: what skill was demonstrated)
- 💱 RECON view (highlights: what value was exchanged)

#### Activity 0.2: Find Yourself in the Data
**Time:** 20 minutes

Given a sample dataset:
1. Find an activity that represents learning
2. Find an activity that represents collaboration
3. Find an activity that represents value exchange

#### Activity 0.3: The Governance Gate
**Time:** 15 minutes

Discussion: "Why can't we just analyze everything?"

Concepts introduced:
- PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
- Bias guardrails ("high activity ≠ high value")
- Prohibited inferences (never predict performance)
- AI-generated code governance (human review required, provenance tracking)

**AI-Generated Code Governance:**
- AI-generated code must pass same governance as human code
- Human review required for all AI-generated code
- Provenance tracking (who/what generated it)
- Audit trails for AI decisions
- See: `curriculum/case_studies/A_SWE_ANALYSIS.md` for full analysis

#### Activity 0.4: Ethical Guardrails
**Time:** 20 minutes

Discussion: "AI as advisor, not authority"

Core principle: **AI that strengthens human agency, privacy, and dignity — not one that replaces them.**

Anti-patterns to avoid:
- ❌ Advisor → Authority (AI making decisions without human approval)
- ❌ Manipulation for profit (optimizing engagement over wellbeing)
- ❌ Surveillance under safety banner (tracking without consent)
- ❌ Centralized sensitive data (data leaving user control)
- ❌ Opaque decisions (no explanation or audit trail)
- ❌ Biased models (gatekeeping opportunity)
- ❌ Dependency by design (making users feel incapable)

See: `TEACHER_ETHICAL_GUARDRAILS.md` for detailed guidance

##### Inspiration: The Labor of Love

> *"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity."*
> 
> — 1 Corinthians 13:13

**Connection:** The goal of AI isn't efficiency—it's freeing humanity for the greatest labor: love. Relationships, care, meaning. When AI handles routine tasks, we're freed for the Labor of Love.

> *"Love is a serious mental disease."*
> 
> — Plato

**Connection:** The "Labor of Love" is not rational efficiency—it's a "disease" that compels us to care, to serve, to give. AI should free us for this irrational but essential work.

> *"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."*
> 
> — Aristotle

**Connection:** The Labor of Love is not a single act—it's a habit, a way of life. AI should free us to make love a habit, not an exception.

> *"I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free."*
> 
> — Michelangelo

**Connection:** AI should free the "angel" in humanity—our capacity for love, care, meaning. We're not creating something new, we're revealing what's already there.

##### Alternative Perspectives: How Other Thinkers Would View "The Labor of Love"

**The Problem:** What should AI free us for? What is the purpose of technology if not efficiency?

**Plato's Approach (Love as Divine Madness):**
> *"Love is a serious mental disease."*
> 
> — Plato

Plato would say: Love is not rational—it's a "disease" that compels us beyond self-interest. AI should free us for this "irrational" but essential work. Efficiency serves the rational; love serves the divine. The Labor of Love is the highest purpose because it connects us to the Forms (ultimate reality).

**Aristotle's Approach (Happiness as Ultimate Purpose):**
> *"Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence."*
> 
> — Aristotle

Aristotle would say: But happiness isn't pleasure—it's eudaimonia (flourishing). The Labor of Love is what makes us flourish. AI should free us for activities that develop virtue, build relationships, and create meaning. This is true happiness.

**Michelangelo's Approach (Love in God's Light):**
> *"I live and love in God's peculiar light."*
> 
> — Michelangelo

Michelangelo would say: The Labor of Love is done in a "peculiar light"—not the light of efficiency, but the light of divine purpose. AI should free us to work in this light—creating beauty, serving others, expressing love.

**Biblical Perspective (Charity as Greatest):**
> *"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity."*
> 
> — 1 Corinthians 13:13

The biblical view: All technical achievement means nothing without love (charity). The Labor of Love is the greatest because it's eternal—relationships, care, meaning outlast all technology.

**Synthesis:** All four perspectives converge: AI's purpose is to free us for love. Plato calls it divine madness, Aristotle calls it eudaimonia, Michelangelo calls it God's light, and the biblical view calls it charity. They all point to the same truth: the Labor of Love is the highest purpose technology can serve.

**Reflection:** What would you do with time freed by AI? How would you use it to love others?

#### Activity 0.5: Negative Patterns Are Not Nonsense (Dirac-Inspired)
**Time:** 25 minutes

**Learning Objective:** Understand that gaps, absences, and inverse relationships are valid insights, not "nonsense" to be ignored.

**Context:** Just as Dirac refused to ignore negative energy solutions and discovered antiparticles, we can find profound insights in what's NOT happening.

**Activity Steps:**

1. **Given a dataset, identify:**
   - What patterns ARE present (positive patterns)
   - What patterns are ABSENT (negative patterns)
   - What relationships are INVERSE (anti-patterns)

2. **For each positive pattern, find its complementary anti-pattern:**
   - High collaboration → Isolation gaps
   - Skill progression → Skill stagnation
   - Provider adoption → Provider abandonment

3. **Explain why the anti-pattern is as important as the pattern:**
   - What does the gap reveal?
   - What opportunity does the absence create?
   - What truth does the inverse relationship show?

**Example:**
```
Positive Pattern: "User A collaborates frequently with Team X"
Anti-Pattern: "User A has NO collaboration with Team Y (despite similar roles)"
Insight: "User A may be siloed in Team X, missing cross-team opportunities"
```

**Key Insight:** Like Dirac's negative energy solutions revealing antiparticles, gaps and absences reveal complementary insights. What's NOT happening is as important as what IS happening.

**CURRICULUM REFERENCE:**
- See: `curriculum/vision/chapters/DIrac_ANTIPATTERNS_APPLICATION.md` for full implementation
- See: `DIRAC_CONCEPTS_APPLICATION_SUMMARY.md` for quick reference

**Inspiration:**
> *"The saddest chapter in modern physics" became one of the most profound discoveries when Dirac refused to ignore negative energy solutions.*

**Connection:** What if our "saddest patterns" — the gaps, the absences, the inverses — become our most profound insights?

#### Activity 0.6: Understanding vs. Information (Dr. K-Inspired)
**Time:** 30 minutes

**Learning Objective:** Distinguish between information (transmissible) and understanding (experiential)

**Context:** Just as Dr. K distinguishes vidya (information) from nan (understanding), learners must understand that some things can be taught, while others must be experienced.

**Activity Steps:**

1. **Given a concept, identify:**
   - What information can be transmitted (vidya - objective, transmissible)
   - What understanding must be experienced (nan - subjective, experiential)

2. **Example:**
   ```
   Concept: "High collaboration with Team X"
   
   Information (vidya - transmissible):
   - "You have 45 interactions with Team X in last 30 days"
   - "This is 30% above average for similar roles"
   - "Team X has 12 members"
   
   Understanding (nan - experiential):
   - "What does this collaboration mean for you?"
   - "How does this feel?"
   - "What does this reveal about your identity?"
   - Cannot be transmitted - must be experienced
   ```

3. **Design an experience:**
   - For each piece of information, design an experience that leads to understanding
   - Information: "You have skill gaps"
   - Experience: "Try this exercise and see how it feels"
   - Understanding: "Now you understand why this matters"

**Key Insight:** Information can be taught. Understanding must be experienced. COSURVIVAL provides information, but users must experience to understand.

**CURRICULUM REFERENCE:**
- See: `curriculum/vision/chapters/DR_K_CONSCIOUSNESS_APPLICATION.md`
- Builds on: Activity 0.5 (Negative Patterns Are Not Nonsense)

**Inspiration:**
> *"Understanding (nan) is subjective, not transmissible. Information (vidya) is objective, transmissible. The big problem in society is everyone is looking for information, but we're looking for understanding."*

**Connection:** We can teach information (patterns, statistics), but understanding (what it means for you, how to act) must be experienced.

# Week 1: Fundamentals

## Theme: "The Policy-First Mindset"

### Learning Objectives
- Understand canonical data types
- Apply governance checks before analysis
- Write pseudocode for data transformation

### Core Concepts

#### 1. Canonical Entities

```python
# The Seven Canonical Entities
User        # A person in the system
Company     # An organization
Group       # A team within an organization  
Provider    # A service/tool supplier
Resource    # A file, API, or digital asset
Activity    # An event that happened
Permission  # A change in access rights
```

#### 2. The Governance Gate (Non-Negotiable)

```
RAW DATA → [GOVERNANCE GATE] → CLEAN DATA → ANALYSIS
              │
              ├── PII Check (hash names, emails)
              ├── Bias Check (no performance inference)
              ├── Scope Check (no prohibited outputs)
              ├── AI Code Check (if AI-generated: human review, provenance tracking)
              └── Review Trigger (human approval needed?)
```

**AI-Generated Code Governance:**
If code or data is AI-generated (e.g., from A-SWE, Copilot, or other AI tools),
additional checks are required: human review, provenance tracking, audit logging.
See: `curriculum/case_studies/A_SWE_ANALYSIS.md` for full analysis.

#### 3. Schema Detection

```
"Uid" → user_id
"CompanyName" → company_name  
"StateOld → StateNew" → permission_change
```

Patterns matter more than exact column names.

### Activities

#### Activity 1.1: Build a Data Dictionary
**Time:** 30 minutes

Given a CSV with 20 columns, create a data dictionary:
- Column name
- Meaning
- Data type
- Sensitivity level (public/internal/confidential/restricted)
- Requires hashing? (yes/no)

#### Activity 1.2: Write Governance Rules
**Time:** 25 minutes

Create 5 rules that should BLOCK analysis:
1. Example: "If the analysis attempts to rank individual performance..."

#### Activity 1.3: Pseudocode Practice
**Time:** 30 minutes

Write pseudocode for:
1. Detecting a user-to-user interaction
2. Detecting a permission upgrade
3. Detecting a provider error

#### Activity 1.4: Multi-Component Wave Functions (Dirac-Inspired)
**Time:** 30 minutes

**Learning Objective:** Understand that complete analysis requires multiple components (like Dirac's four-component wave function)

**Context:** Just as Dirac's wave function needed four components (spin up/down electron, spin up/down positron), COSURVIVAL analysis needs four components: TRIBE, TEACHER, RECON, and ANTI-PATTERNS.

**Activity Steps:**

1. **Analyze the same dataset through four components:**
   - **TRIBE component:** Collaboration patterns (positive)
   - **TEACHER component:** Learning patterns (positive)
   - **RECON component:** Value exchange patterns (positive)
   - **ANTI-PATTERN component:** Gaps and absences (negative)

2. **Show how each component reveals different aspects:**
   - TRIBE: "Who is connected?"
   - TEACHER: "Who is learning?"
   - RECON: "What value is exchanged?"
   - ANTI-PATTERNS: "What's missing?"

3. **Unify all four into a single coherent insight:**
   - Write a paragraph that synthesizes all four components
   - Explain how they complement each other

**Example:**
```
TRIBE: "User A collaborates with Team X"
TEACHER: "User A is learning data governance"
RECON: "User A uses Provider Y for analytics"
ANTI-PATTERN: "User A has NO collaboration with security team (despite learning security-relevant skills)"
UNIFIED: "User A is developing security skills but not connecting with security team - potential bridge opportunity"
```

**Key Insight:** Like Dirac's four-component wave function revealing complete electron states, four-component analysis reveals complete understanding.

**CURRICULUM REFERENCE:**
- See: `curriculum/vision/chapters/DIrac_ANTIPATTERNS_APPLICATION.md`
- Builds on: Activity 0.5 (Negative Patterns Are Not Nonsense)

#### Activity 1.5: Layers of Reality in Data Analysis (Dr. K-Inspired)
**Time:** 35 minutes

**Learning Objective:** Understand that data analysis operates at multiple layers (physical, mental, consciousness)

**Context:** Just as Dr. K describes layers of reality (physical, mental, spiritual), data analysis has layers (raw data, patterns, meaning).

**Activity Steps:**

1. **Identify three layers in data analysis:**
   - **Physical Layer**: Raw data, measurable metrics (brain scans, activity counts)
   - **Mental Layer**: Patterns, insights, recommendations (thoughts, emotions - derived, not directly measurable)
   - **Consciousness Layer**: User's subjective experience, meaning, purpose (cannot be detected, only reported)

2. **Show how each layer is different:**
   - Physical: "45 interactions" (measurable)
   - Mental: "High collaboration pattern" (derived, not directly measurable)
   - Consciousness: "This collaboration feels meaningful" (cannot be detected, only reported)

3. **Explain the relationship:**
   - Physical layer affects mental layer
   - Mental layer affects consciousness layer
   - But they're qualitatively different

**Example:**
```
Physical: "User A has 45 interactions with Team X" (measurable)
Mental: "This indicates high collaboration" (derived, not directly measurable)
Consciousness: "User A feels connected and valued" (cannot be detected, only reported)
```

**Key Insight:** We can measure data, derive patterns, but cannot detect user experience. We must rely on user reports and always acknowledge: "I can see patterns, but I cannot know your experience."

**CURRICULUM REFERENCE:**
- See: `curriculum/vision/chapters/DR_K_CONSCIOUSNESS_APPLICATION.md`
- Builds on: Activity 0.6 (Understanding vs. Information)

### Checkpoint 1

# Week 2: Data Structures

## Theme: "Canonical Representations"

### Learning Objectives
- Design schemas for the seven canonical entities
- Understand graph structures for relationships
- Validate data against schemas

### Core Concepts

#### 1. Entity Schemas

```python
@dataclass
class CanonicalUser:
    id: str                    # Hashed for privacy
    email_domain: str          # Preserved for org analysis
    company_id: str
    roles: List[str]
    groups: List[str]
    activity_count: int
    first_seen: datetime
    last_seen: datetime
```

#### 2. Graph Structures

```
TRIBE Graph:
- Nodes: Users, Groups, Companies
- Edges: Collaboration, Membership, Hierarchy
- Weights: Interaction frequency

Example:
User_A ──[collaborated 15x]──> User_B
   │                             │
   └──[member of]──> Group_X <──┘
```

#### 3. Event Stores

```json
{
  "id": "evt_001",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "type": "document_access",
  "user_id": "entity_abc123",
  "resource_id": "doc_xyz789",
  "target_user_id": "entity_def456",
  "state_before": "viewer",
  "state_after": "editor"
}
```

### Activities

# Week 3: Algorithms

## Theme: "MVP Extractors"

### Learning Objectives
- Implement collaboration strength algorithm
- Implement role mastery profiler
- Implement provider reliability scorer
- Understand Big O basics

### Core Concepts

#### 1. TRIBE Algorithms

```python
def collaboration_strength(user_a, user_b, activities):
    """
    Measures how strongly two users collaborate.
    
    Factors:
    - Direct interactions (UidOpp/UidReq)
    - Co-resource access (same file on same day)
    - Shared group membership
    """
    direct = count_direct_interactions(user_a, user_b, activities)
    co_access = count_co_resource_access(user_a, user_b, activities)
    shared_groups = count_shared_groups(user_a, user_b)
    
    return (direct * 0.5) + (co_access * 0.3) + (shared_groups * 0.2)
```

#### 2. TEACHER Algorithms

```python
def role_mastery_profile(user, permission_changes):
    """
    Builds a skill profile from permission history.
    
    Key insight: Permission upgrades = skill demonstrations
    """
    skills = []
    for change in permission_changes:
        if change.user_id == user.id:
            if is_upgrade(change.state_before, change.state_after):
                skills.append(extract_skill(change))
    
    return MasteryProfile(
        user_id=user.id,
        skills=skills,
        trajectory="growing" if len(skills) > baseline else "stable"
    )
```

#### 3. RECON Algorithms

```python
def provider_reliability_score(provider, activities):
    """
    Scores provider reliability.
    
    Score = 1 - (errors / total_activities)
    """
    total = count_activities(provider, activities)
    errors = count_errors(provider, activities)
    
    return 1 - (errors / total) if total > 0 else 0
```

#### 4. Efficiency Matters

| Algorithm | Naive | Optimized | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Find user | O(n) | O(1) hash | 1M users = 1M vs 1 lookup |
| Build graph | O(n²) | O(n log n) | 10K users = 100M vs 130K ops |
| Community detection | O(n³) | O(n log n) | Makes it possible at all |

# Appendix: Mastery Tracking Philosophy

## The Self-Relative Principle

```
NEVER:
- Rank learners against each other
- Label skill gaps as "deficiencies"
- Use activity volume as quality proxy

ALWAYS:
- Compare learner to their own baseline
- Frame gaps as "growth opportunities"
- Celebrate trajectory over position
```

## Progress Display

```
Instead of:  "You are at level 3 (class average: 4.2)"

Display:     "Since you started:
              ✓ +2 new capabilities unlocked
              ✓ 3 concepts mastered
              ✓ On track for Week 3 checkpoint"
```

## The Growth Mindset in Code

```python
def display_progress(learner):
    baseline = learner.starting_snapshot
    current = learner.current_snapshot
    
    gains = current.skills - baseline.skills
    
    return {
        "message": f"You've unlocked {len(gains)} new capabilities since you began.",
        "gains": list(gains),
        "trajectory": calculate_trajectory(learner),
        # NEVER include: rank, percentile, comparison to others
    }
```
