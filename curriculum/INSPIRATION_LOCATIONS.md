## High-Priority Integration Points

### 1. Week 0: Concepts - "Making Data Alive"

**File:** `curriculum/core/TEACHER_CORE_TRACK.md`  
**Location:** Lines 37-51 (after "Everything is 0s and 1s" concept)  
**Theme:** Meaning through perspective, context creates truth

**Suggested Content:**
- **1 Corinthians 13:12** - "For now we see through a glass, darkly..."
- **Plato's Allegory of the Cave** - Different shadows, same object
- **Plato** - "The beginning is the most important part of the work"
- **Plato** - "Knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind"
- **Aristotle** - "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts"
- **Aristotle** - "It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it"
- **Michelangelo** - "I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free"
- **Rumi quote** - Same water, different effects

**Integration Format:**
```markdown
#### Inspiration: Meaning Through Perspective

> *"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known."*
> 
> — 1 Corinthians 13:12

**Connection:** Just as we see truth partially now, we see data through different lenses. The same activity row means different things through TRIBE (relationships), TEACHER (growth), and RECON (value) perspectives. Understanding grows as we view from multiple angles.
```

### 2. Week 0: "The Labor of Love"

**File:** `curriculum/core/TEACHER_CORE_TRACK.md`  
**Location:** After Activity 0.4 (around line 116) or in closing reflection  
**Theme:** Purpose, meaning, what we're freed for

**Suggested Content:**
- **1 Corinthians 13:13** - "The greatest of these is charity"
- **Matthew 22:37-39** - "Love the Lord... and thy neighbour"
- **Plato** - "Love is a serious mental disease" / "At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet"
- **Aristotle** - "Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life" / "We are what we repeatedly do"
- **Michelangelo** - "I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free"
- **Martin Luther King Jr.** - "What are you doing for others?"

**Integration Format:**
```markdown
### The Labor of Love

> *"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity."*
> 
> — 1 Corinthians 13:13

**Connection:** The goal of AI isn't efficiency—it's freeing humanity for the greatest labor: love. Relationships, care, meaning. When AI handles routine tasks, we're freed for the Labor of Love.

**Reflection:** What would you do with time freed by AI? How would you use it to love others?
```

### 3. Week 4: Memory of Trust

**File:** `curriculum/core/TEACHER_WEEK4.md`  
**Location:** Lines 31-40 (after "Data Has Memory" concept)  
**Theme:** Trust, safety, boundaries, protection

**Suggested Content:**
- **Proverbs 3:5-6** - "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart"
- **Psalm 91:1-2** - "Refuge and fortress"
- **Proverbs 22:3** - "Prudent man foreseeth the evil"
- **Plato** - "The price of apathy towards public affairs is to be ruled by evil men"
- **Aristotle** - "The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet"
- **Michelangelo** - "The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high"

**Integration Format:**
```markdown
### Inspiration: Trust Requires Boundaries

> *"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths."*
> 
> — Proverbs 3:5-6

**Connection:** Trust requires boundaries. We trust systems that have proper safeguards—just as we trust paths that are clearly marked. Data needs "secret places" and "fortresses"—proper boundaries and protection. Lens boundaries are like guardrails on a path: they don't restrict freedom, they protect it.
```

### 4. Week 5: Structures of Fairness

**File:** `curriculum/core/TEACHER_WEEK5.md`  
**Location:** Lines 30-40 (after "Structures Encode Morality" concept)  
**Theme:** Justice, fairness, equity

**Suggested Content:**
- **Micah 6:8** - "Do justly, and to love mercy"
- **Proverbs 11:1** - "A just weight"
- **Plato** - "Justice in the hearts of citizens" / "The measure of a man is what he does with power"
- **Aristotle** - "Justice is the bond of men in states" / "The worst form of inequality"
- **Michelangelo** - "Every block of stone has a statue inside it"
- **John Rawls** - "Justice is the first virtue"

**Integration Format:**
```markdown
### Inspiration: Structures Encode Justice

> *"He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"*
> 
> — Micah 6:8

**Connection:** Data structures are moral choices. Queues ensure fairness (FIFO = no favoritism). Hash functions must be just (no bias). Balanced trees ensure equity (no one path dominates). The structures we choose encode our values—justice, mercy, humility.
```

### 5. Week 10: Security - Protection

> *"The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore."*
> 
> — Psalm 121:7-8

**Connection:** Security preserves. We preserve data, privacy, and trust. Defense in depth—multiple layers of security (hashing, validation, boundaries)—preserves what matters. Just as protection preserves life, security preserves digital integrity.
```

- **Matthew 25:40** - "Done it unto one of the least of these"
- **Mother Teresa** - "Small things with great love"

**Integration Format:**
```markdown
### The Labor of Love

> *"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass... And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor... and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing."*
> 
> — 1 Corinthians 13:1-3

**Connection:** All our technical achievement means nothing without love. The Labor of Love is the purpose—relationships, care, meaning. AI should free us for this greatest labor.
```

> *"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children."*
> 
> — Deuteronomy 6:6-7

**Connection:** Cross-generational learning—elders teach values, wisdom, meaning. AI teaches technology, patterns, opportunities. Together, they create holistic growth: technical skills + spiritual foundation.
```

### 8. Ethics: "AI as Advisor, Not Authority"

**File:** `curriculum/ethics/TEACHER_ETHICAL_GUARDRAILS.md`

- **Immanuel Kant** - "Treat humanity as an end"

```markdown
## Core Principle

**AI as Advisor, Not Authority**

> *"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him."*
> 
> — Genesis 1:27

**Connection:** Humans have inherent dignity. AI should enhance, not replace, human agency. We are created with the capacity to choose, to love, to create. AI advises, but humans choose. This preserves our dignity and agency.
```

---

### 9. Cross-Generational Learning

**File:** `curriculum/core/TEACHER_WEEK_AI.md` or `teacher_advisor.py` documentation  
**Location:** In "Cross-Generational Learning" section  
**Theme:** Wisdom, learning from elders, teaching younger

**Suggested Content:**
- **Titus 2:3-4** - "Aged women... teach the young"
- **Proverbs 13:20** - "Walk with wise men"
- **Confucius** - "Three methods we may learn wisdom"

**Integration Format:**
```markdown
### Cross-Generational Learning

> *"The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness... That they may teach the young women."*
> 
> — Titus 2:3-4

**Connection:** Cross-generational learning—elders teach values, wisdom, meaning. AI learns from wise elders (values, wisdom) and teaches younger generations (technology). This creates a virtuous cycle: wisdom flows down, technology flows up.
```

### 10. Week 1: Fundamentals - Data Dictionary

**File:** `curriculum/core/TEACHER_WEEK1.md`

**Theme:** Clarity, understanding, foundation

**Suggested Content:**
- **Proverbs 4:7** - "Get wisdom... get understanding"
- **1 Corinthians 14:8** - "Uncertain sound"

**Integration Format:**
```markdown
### Inspiration: Understanding is the Foundation

> *"Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding."*
> 
> — Proverbs 4:7

**Connection:** Data dictionary provides understanding—the foundation of wisdom. Without clear schemas, we have confusion. With understanding, we have wisdom. The data dictionary is the foundation that makes all else possible.
```
