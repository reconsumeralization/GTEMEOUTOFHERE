## Curriculum Philosophy

> *"What ultimately matters is not where you end up relative to your classmates, but where you end up relative to yourself when you began."*

**Core Principles:**
1. **Self-relative comparison only** - Never compare learners to each other
2. **Growth opportunities, not deficiencies** - Frame progress positively
3. **Trajectory over position** - Measure improvement, not status
4. **Celebration of gains** - Acknowledge every step forward

**Ethical Foundation:**
> *"AI that strengthens human agency, privacy, and dignity — not one that replaces them."*

**Security Foundation:**
> *"Trust is a supply chain problem—of code, data, identity, and human integrity. No single tool, file, or community action can become a silent pivot into global harm."*

## Learning Architecture

```
CONCEPTS → FUNDAMENTALS → STRUCTURES → ALGORITHMS → DOMAINS → CAPSTONE
   ↓           ↓             ↓            ↓           ↓          ↓
 Week 0     Week 1        Week 2       Week 3     Week 4+    Final
 Visual     Formal        Canonical    Extractors  Applied    Real
 Intuition  Primitives    Entities     + Models    Systems    World
```

This curriculum transforms any learner from "what is data?" to "I can build ethical intelligence systems."
