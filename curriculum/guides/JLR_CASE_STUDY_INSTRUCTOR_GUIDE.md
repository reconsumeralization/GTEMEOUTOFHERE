## Facilitation Strategies

### Opening (5 minutes)

**Hook:**
> "Jaguar Land Rover, a flagship British manufacturer, lost billions due to security failures that could have been prevented with basic controls. Today, we'll analyze what went wrong and how COSURVIVAL principles would have prevented it."

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand JLR's security failures
- Map failures to COSURVIVAL prevention strategies
- Generate actionable recommendations

**Connection to Previous Learning:**
- "This builds on Week 0 (governance gate) and Week 10 (security implementation)"
- "We'll apply what we learned about proactive governance and foundational controls"

## Case Study Section Facilitation (45 minutes)

### Part 1: Context and Failures (15 minutes)

**Activity:** Read case study section together

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. "What surprised you about JLR's failures?"
2. "Why do you think foundational controls were ignored?"
3. "What patterns do you see in the timeline?"

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Foundational controls are not "nice to have"—they're required
- Security failures compound over time
- Reactive response costs far more than proactive prevention

**Common Student Questions:**

**Q: "Why didn't JLR fix these issues earlier?"**
A: This is the core lesson—security was treated as an IT problem, not a business risk. When security is isolated from business decisions, foundational controls get deprioritized.

**Q: "How much would it have cost to fix these proactively?"**
A: Estimated £5-10M for foundational controls vs. billions in reactive costs. ROI of proactive security is massive.

**Q: "Could this happen to any organization?"**
A: Yes—this is why COSURVIVAL's governance-first architecture is essential. Any organization can fall into these patterns.

### Part 2: COSURVIVAL Analysis (15 minutes)

**Activity:** Map JLR failures to COSURVIVAL principles

**Group Exercise:**
1. Divide into small groups (3-4 learners)
2. Each group maps one failure to COSURVIVAL principles
3. Groups share findings

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. "Which COSURVIVAL principle would have prevented this failure?"
2. "How does the governance gate address this?"
3. "What foundational controls are missing?"

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Security by design prevents these failures
- Governance gate catches issues before they become incidents
- Foundational controls are implemented from day one in COSURVIVAL

### Part 3: Impact and Lessons (15 minutes)

**Activity:** Analyze impact and generate recommendations

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. "What was the business impact of these failures?"
2. "How does this affect trust and confidence?"
3. "What would you recommend to JLR?"

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Security failures have business consequences
- Trust is a strategic asset
- Proactive governance prevents catastrophic failures

## Activity 10.6 Facilitation (60 minutes)

### Part 1: Identify Failures (15 minutes)

**Activity:** Code walkthrough of failure identification

**Facilitation Tips:**
- Start with starter code
- Walk through one failure example together
- Let learners complete the rest independently

**Common Challenges:**
- Learners may struggle with technical details
- **Solution:** Focus on concepts first, then technical implementation

### Part 2: Map to COSURVIVAL Principles (15 minutes)

**Activity:** Map failures to prevention strategies

**Facilitation Tips:**
- Use the comparison table from case study
- Encourage learners to explain their mappings
- Connect to Week 0 and Week 10 concepts

**Common Challenges:**
- Learners may not see connections
- **Solution:** Use concrete examples: "How would governance gate have prevented TLS failures?"

### Part 3: Analyze Impact (15 minutes)

**Activity:** Quantify and analyze impact

**Facilitation Tips:**
- Use cost-benefit analysis template
- Encourage learners to think about business metrics
- Connect to business risk concepts

**Common Challenges:**
- Learners may focus only on technical impact
- **Solution:** Ask: "What does this mean for the business? For customers? For trust?"

### Part 4: Generate Recommendations (15 minutes)

**Activity:** Create actionable recommendations

**Facilitation Tips:**
- Use reflection questions to guide thinking
- Encourage prioritization of recommendations
- Connect to implementation details

**Common Challenges:**
- Recommendations may be too vague
- **Solution:** Ask: "How would you implement this? What would it cost? What's the timeline?"

## Discussion Facilitation

### Common Student Questions

**Q: "Is JLR still vulnerable?"**
A: Yes—the case study notes that foundational failures remain unresolved. This demonstrates the challenge of reactive security.

**Q: "How does this relate to my organization?"**
A: Many organizations have similar patterns—security as IT problem, reactive governance, ignored foundational controls. This is why COSURVIVAL principles are universal.

**Q: "What if we can't afford proactive security?"**
A: The JLR case shows that reactive costs far exceed proactive investment. The question isn't "can we afford it?" but "can we afford not to?"

**Q: "How do we convince leadership that security is a business risk?"**
A: Use the JLR case study—show the business impact (billions in costs, lost trust, supply chain disruption). Security failures are business failures.

### Discussion Prompts

**For Deeper Understanding:**
1. "What would have happened if JLR had a governance gate?"
2. "How would security by design have changed the outcome?"
3. "What patterns do you see in organizations you know?"

**For Application:**
1. "How would you apply these lessons to your own context?"
2. "What foundational controls are most critical?"
3. "How would you prioritize security investments?"

2. Identify areas of growth
3. Set goals for improvement

**Instructor Feedback:**
1. Use rubric criteria for specific feedback
2. Focus on growth, not perfection
3. Celebrate progress at any level

**Common Feedback Patterns:**

**For Emerging Learners:**
- "Great start identifying failures. Next, try mapping to COSURVIVAL principles."
- "You've identified the impact. Now quantify it with business metrics."

**For Developing Learners:**
- "Good mapping to principles. Add more detail on how prevention works."
- "Solid recommendations. Prioritize them by business impact."

**For Proficient Learners:**
- "Excellent analysis. Extend to other case studies."
- "Strong recommendations. Add implementation details and timelines."

## Troubleshooting

### Common Challenges

**Challenge: Learners don't see relevance**
- **Solution:** Connect to their own contexts. Ask: "What patterns do you see in organizations you know?"

**Challenge: Technical details overwhelm**
- **Solution:** Focus on concepts first. Use analogies. Simplify technical explanations.

**Challenge: Discussion stalls**
- **Solution:** Use specific prompts. Ask follow-up questions. Use think-pair-share.

**Challenge: Time constraints**
- **Solution:** Prioritize core learning (COSURVIVAL mapping). Skip extensions if needed.
