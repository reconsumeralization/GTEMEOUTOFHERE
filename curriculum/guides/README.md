# Implementation Guides

## Overview

Practical guides that bridge curriculum concepts to code implementation.

---

## Documents

### Code Mapping
- **`CODE_TO_CURRICULUM_MAP.md`** - Maps code modules to curriculum weeks
  - Which code implements which concepts
  - Where to find examples
  - How curriculum maps to features

### CS50 Application
- **`CS50_CONCEPTS_APPLIED.md`** - How CS50 concepts apply to COSURVIVAL
  - Week-by-week mapping
  - Concept translations
  - Implementation examples

### Family Implementation
- **`FAMILY_COSURVIVAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - Family-centered implementation guide
  - Family AI vision
  - Cross-generational learning
  - Labor of Love metrics

### Thesis → Product Mapping
- **`TEACHER_THESIS_PRD_MAP.md`** - Thesis → epics → user stories
  - Chapter-to-epic alignment
  - Illustrative user stories and acceptance notes
  - Keeps narrative traceable to execution

### Unified PRD
- **`PRD_UNIFIED_ECOSYSTEM.md`** - Full production-grade PRD (Reconsumeralization / TEACHER / TRIBES / COURSES / SECURITY)

### Model Welfare

## Usage

### For Developers
- **Learning the codebase:** Start with `CODE_TO_CURRICULUM_MAP.md`
- **Understanding CS50 influence:** Read `CS50_CONCEPTS_APPLIED.md`
- **Family features:** See `FAMILY_COSURVIVAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

### For Curriculum Designers
- **Code examples:** Use `CODE_TO_CURRICULUM_MAP.md` to find examples
- **Concept implementation:** See how CS50 concepts translate
- **Feature documentation:** Link code to curriculum
