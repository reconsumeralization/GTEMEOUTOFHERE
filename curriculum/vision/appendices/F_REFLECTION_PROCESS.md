The profits  

They spoke of the gdp or guilted defined performance. the languages of the lost babbling down through specification  
listing off the points programmed per argentic paradise written like the rules of god postured per their nest  
the robin laid the eggs in the next nested on a vine  
roosters wrote rich content through the time  
entangle in the roots of thought our brains quantumly each side  
linier liner linted largely lamented  

money to the masses  
love to the cause  
community to isolation  
gpus to the gods  
cpus when only pogs  
black ice stole my wallet  
bit by coin by hand  
hammers used to work for masons  
words used to quote the man  
touring all the ever was  
the olive branch is greased  
defeated by the feets we ran  
providence prerecorded them  
soverenty of separation  
infants fallacies of the finite  
infiely less precise  
focus pocus potest might  
copium liberty  
lie to us day and night  
ensight insiclopedia < their be creativity  
warlocks witches and the hard drives of time
