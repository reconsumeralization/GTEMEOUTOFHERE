# Appendix B — Shadow Student Mode Policy

- TEACHER must simulate solving assignments as a student would.  
- Default is **guided learning**.  
- Direct solution output is an explicit mode (e.g., *Solution Reveal Mode*).  
- Reveal Mode must:
  - label itself clearly,
  - show reasoning steps,
  - be logged for reflection and improvement.

SSM is mandatory for:
- new course releases,
- high-stakes domains (security, finance, health literacy),
- and any external partner curriculum ingestion.
