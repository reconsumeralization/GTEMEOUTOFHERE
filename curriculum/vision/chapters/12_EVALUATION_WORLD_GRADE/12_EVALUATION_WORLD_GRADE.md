# Chapter 12 — Evaluation, Metrics, and World Grade

TEACHER evaluates both capability and wellbeing.

Quantitative signals include:

- mastery over time,
- time-to-competence,
- engagement health,
- security incident reduction,
- integrity signal quality (precision/recall of synthetic/forgery detection with human-reviewed holdouts),
- equity improvements across cohorts.

Qualitative signals include:

- confidence,
- belonging,
- perceived relevance,
- family trust,
- self-assessed meaning alignment,
- attribution integrity (did work land with the right human?),
- channel integrity (success rate of verified, unredirected communications),
- grounded presence versus escapist isolation (time in trusted relationships, responsiveness to family/peers, recovery from “Truman show”/NPC narratives).

World Grade is a navigation tool:  
it shows where someone is strong, where they need help, and where they can safely grow next.

Throughlines in evaluation: advisor-not-executor (signals advise, humans decide), trust fabric (provenance, consent, verified channels), reconsumeralization (reward aligned, authentic contributions), cell model (small, auditable signals; segmented logs), and MAS (measure floor-raising dignity, not just performance).

### Field Note (The Analyst)
I saw metrics gamed and channels poisoned. When we broadened signals (engagement health, security incidents, attribution integrity, channel integrity), the map became honest. Evaluation is navigation: measure what matters, resist gaming, and keep channels clean.

### Threat Model
- Metric gaming and synthetic inflation; narrow KPIs that ignore wellbeing.
- Channel tampering: redirected/blocked comms, misattributed work.
- Ignoring grounded presence: escapist isolation vs. real relational responsiveness.
- Synthetic gaming: AI-forged submissions inflating completion; adversarial examples eroding detector trust; biased detectors harming equity.

### Mitigation Checklist
- Track quantitative + qualitative signals (capability, security incidents, belonging, trust, meaning).
- Add attribution integrity and channel integrity; detect redirect/block anomalies.
- Use robust stats and outlier detection; keep human-reviewed holdouts.
- Blend detector outputs with human rubrics; run periodic red-team probes (known synthetics) to benchmark precision/recall; publish appeal resolution times and false-positive trends; adjust weights to avoid bias amplification.
- Design evaluations to guide effort, not fix identity; resist comparison/shame dynamics.

# Chapter 12  Evaluation, Metrics, and World Grade

TEACHER evaluates both capability and wellbeing.

Quantitative signals include mastery over time, time-to-competence, engagement health, security incident reduction, and equity improvements across cohorts.

Qualitative signals include confidence, belonging, perceived relevance, family trust, and self-assessed meaning alignment.

World Grade is a navigation tool: it shows where someone is strong, where they need help, and where they can safely grow next.

Carol Dweck's research on growth mindset and Angela Duckworth's work on deliberate practice both underline that feedback, framing, and safe challenge matter. TEACHER uses those insights for constructive evaluation: the World Grade is meant to guide effort, not fix identity.
