# Chapter 8 — Reconsumeralization: Ethics as an Economic Primitive

Reconsumeralization is the economic mirror of TEACHER.

It creates a public-facing trust layer for:

- suppliers,
- products,
- and manufacturing practices,

using transparent, dispute-aware signals from:

- consumer experiences,
- independent audits,
- sustainability metrics,
- labor and safety practices.

Key mechanisms include:

- supplier profiles,
- value and quality rankings,
- consumer education,
- fact-checking and response workflows.

### Integration with TEACHER
Students can learn real-world ethics by:

- analyzing supply chains,
- improving transparency,
- and participating in tribe-led service or marketplace accountability projects.

This is how education becomes **economic moral infrastructure**.

### Field Note (The Analyst)
I traced a mislabeled “ethical” product line whose attestations were forged. The fix wasn’t a press release—it was signed provenance, tamper-evident SBOMs, and cross-checks against trusted oracles. Transparency beats branding when truth is at stake.

### Threat Model
- Forged provenance and data poisoning in supplier profiles.
- Fake audits/ratings; manipulated sustainability or labor claims.
- Supply-chain substitution of unsafe components.

### Mitigation Checklist
- Signed attestations; verifiable SBOM; reproducible builds; independent audits.
- Cross-check claims with trusted oracles; anomaly detection on ratings/reviews.
- Quarantine unverified feeds; require human confirmation for high-impact label changes.

Consumers International and OECD research on trustworthy marketplaces show that transparency and dispute mechanisms increase both safety and innovation. Reconsumeralization bakes those findings in, echoing Amartya Sen's framing that development is "freedom"—including the freedom to choose ethical, safe products with clear provenance.
