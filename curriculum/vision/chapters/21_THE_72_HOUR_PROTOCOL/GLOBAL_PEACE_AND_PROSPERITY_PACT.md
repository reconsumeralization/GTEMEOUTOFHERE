# THE GLOBAL PEACE AND PROSPERITY PACT

**The Official Text of the Global Covenant**

---

## PREAMBLE

We, the People and Nations of Earth — mindful of the suffering wrought by war, poverty, hunger, inequality, environmental degradation, and the looming threat of mass destruction — reaffirm our commitment to the dignity of every human being, to the sanctity of life, and to future generations who will inherit this planet. We draw inspiration from prior global instruments — such as the Charter of the United Nations (UN) — which sought to "save succeeding generations from the scourge of war" and promote "social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom."

We recognize that peace, security, justice, and prosperity are inseparable — that enduring world peace requires not only the absence of war, but justice, human dignity, equitable opportunity, and sustainable stewardship of the Earth's resources.

Guided by the principles of mutual respect, solidarity, equity, and shared responsibility, we hereby adopt the following declaration, calling upon all states, institutions, civil societies, and individuals to join in building a new era of global peace, prosperity, and cooperation.

Every person shall enjoy the right to food, water, shelter, health, education, and basic human dignity, irrespective of nationality, ethnicity, religion, or status.

We commit to the reduction and elimination of all weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons; promote transparency, arms-control treaties, and confidence-building measures among states.

We commit to eradicating extreme poverty, hunger, and systemic exploitation through fair economic policies, social protections, debt relief where applicable, and socially responsible development.

We support the transition to sustainable, clean, and widely accessible energy; commit to global cooperation on renewable energy infrastructure, energy access, and fair allocation of energy resources.

### Global Solidarity & Cooperation
We affirm that existential threats — war, climate collapse, poverty — require united global action and shared burden; we reject unilateralism, coercive domination, and zero-sum geopolitics.

### Transparency, Accountability & Governance
We commit to transparent institutions, open governance, independent oversight, and inclusion of civil society and local communities in decision-making.

## Connection to the 72-Hour Protocol

This Global Peace and Prosperity Pact is the formal text of the "Global Covenant" referenced throughout the 72-Hour Protocol. It represents the binding treaty that:

- Eliminates nuclear weapons and other WMDs
- Ends extreme poverty and creates universal prosperity
- Creates universal energy access by 2035
- Establishes transparent, accountable governance
- Promotes global cooperation and solidarity

The Pact is signed and ratified as part of the 72-Hour Protocol's execution, with 25 nations initially signing at the Earthdance +30 Days moment, and 80 nations joining within one year.

**Field Note**: A diplomat who participated in the Pact's drafting later wrote: "This wasn't just a treaty. It was a declaration of intent. A commitment to a different way of being. A promise to future generations that we would choose life over death, abundance over scarcity, cooperation over conflict. That's what made it real. That's what made it matter. The promise we made to each other—and to the future."
