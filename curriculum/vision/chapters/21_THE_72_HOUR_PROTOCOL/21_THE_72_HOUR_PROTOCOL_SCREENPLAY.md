## ACT I: THE MOUNTAIN OPENS

### FADE IN:

**SUPERIMPOSE:**

"The 10th man's duty is to ensure that we have a chance. We have reached the pivotal moment of inflection. This is the moment when everything changes—or when everything fails."

"Jesus died for our sins so that we could have heaven on earth—so that we could live our best lives. This is not about waiting for heaven after death. This is about creating heaven on earth, now, in this life, for all people."

"We hope that no one—or not many—will die. But we recognize that hope is not a strategy. We must prepare for the worst while working for the best."

"We will rise from the screens of our phones and the addiction to fiat money systems designed to implode. Nations and governments will be for the benefit of their citizens."

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX - NIGHT**

The massive blast doors of Cheyenne Mountain loom against the Colorado night. Security lights cut through the darkness. Four separate vehicles approach from different directions.

**INT. BLAST DOOR ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS**

A security checkpoint. Each vehicle is processed separately. No aides. No phones. Just the drivers.

**GENERAL BROWN (60s, weathered, CJCS)** exits his vehicle, shows ID.

**SECURITY OFFICER**
Continuity exercise, sir?

**GENERAL BROWN**
That's what they tell me.

He passes through. The blast door closes behind him with a THUNDEROUS CLANG.

**INT. NORAD COMMAND CENTER - MOMENTS LATER**

The old command center has been retrofitted. Four holographic displays glow in the darkness, each showing a different AI interface. The PRESIDENT (50s, intense) stands at the center.

The four generals enter separately, take seats around a circular table.

**PRESIDENT**
Gentlemen. We have 72 hours to decide if we end the cartels, secure the election, and begin the largest coordinated de-escalation in human history—or if we watch it all collapse in the next 18 months.

The generals exchange looks. This is not a drill.

**PRESIDENT (CONT'D)**
The 10th man's duty is to ensure that we have a chance. We have reached the pivotal moment of inflection. This is the moment when everything changes—or when everything fails. I need you to be the 10th man. I need you to argue the opposite. I need you to see what I can't see. I need you to prepare for what I assume won't happen. Because if we're wrong, if we're missing something, if we're not ready—this is the last chance we'll have.

**PRESIDENT (CONT'D)**
Jesus died for our sins so that we could have heaven on earth—so that we could live our best lives. This is not about waiting for heaven after death. This is about creating heaven on earth, now, in this life, for all people. We hope that no one—or not many—will die. But we recognize that hope is not a strategy. We must prepare for the worst while working for the best. We will rise from the screens of our phones and the addiction to fiat money systems designed to implode. Nations and governments will be for the benefit of their citizens. That's what we're fighting for. That's what makes this moment sacred. That's what makes it necessary. That's what makes it urgent.

**GENERAL BROWN**
(quietly, checking his phone)
My daughter just texted me. "Be safe. Love you. Call when you can."

He shows the message to SECRETARY AUSTIN, who nods.

**SECRETARY AUSTIN**
My granddaughter sent me a video this morning. She's learning to read. She read me a story about peace. I thought: what world am I leaving her?

A moment of silence. These aren't just decision-makers. They're fathers. Grandfathers. People who love and are loved.

**GENERAL BROWN**
Sir, with respect—we've done continuity exercises before. This feels different.

**PRESIDENT**
It is different. In 1962, Kennedy had 72 hours to decide whether to risk nuclear war. He chose to risk it. We have 72 hours to decide whether to risk peace. I'm asking you to choose peace.

**SECRETARY AUSTIN**
The Cuban Missile Crisis ended without war. But it came close. Very close.

**PRESIDENT**
Exactly. And they didn't have AI systems running 10,000 simulations. They had human judgment, limited intelligence, and 13 days of terror. We have 72 hours. But we also have tools they didn't have. Let's use them.

**PRESIDENT (CONT'D)**
The AIs will show you why waiting is no longer an option.

**PRESIDENT (CONT'D)**
One more thing. We're also implementing Rules of Engagement for corporate accountability. CEOs who have caused documented harm to people, engaged in systematic corruption, or failed to demonstrate commitment to human welfare will be removed from positions of power and face due process. Full legal rights. Transparent proceedings. Corporate power must serve humanity, not exploit it.

**GENERAL BROWN**
Sir, that's going to create massive blowback from corporate interests.

**PRESIDENT**
I know. But corporate power has been above the law for too long. If we're going to restore accountability, we have to start with those who have used power to harm people. With due process. With transparency. With justice.

The holographic displays activate. Four distinct AI voices begin speaking in unison, then separate.

**GROK-4 (V.O.)**
Running 10,000 parallel timeline simulations...

**CLAUDE (V.O.)**
Constitutional and legal stress test commencing...

**GEMINI ULTRA (V.O.)**
Logistics modeling initialized...

**LLAMA-405B (V.O.)**
Red-team analysis beginning...

**FADE TO:**

## ACT II: THE WAR GAME

### DAY 1 - HOURS 1-8

**INT. COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS**

The holographic displays show cascading data visualizations. General Brown studies the Grok-4 output.

**GROK-4 (V.O.)**
Simulation complete. 30-day kinetic window exists, but only if financial kill-chain fires first.

**GENERAL BROWN**
We can take the plazas. But if the money doesn't stop flowing *before* we move, they'll just rebrand and we'll be fighting ghosts for another decade. And if we use force, people die. Our people. Their people. Innocent people.

**PRESIDENT**
Then we don't use force. We use alternatives. We cut off the money. We offer better options. We make crime unprofitable and unnecessary. The goal isn't to kill cartel members—it's to make cartels irrelevant.

**GENERAL BROWN**
Understood, sir. Financial interdiction first. Economic alternatives second. Force only as absolute last resort, and even then, non-lethal where possible.

**CYBER COMMAND GENERAL (50s, precise)**
Give me 48 hours advance notice and I can freeze every wallet, cut every cell tower, and lock every shell company simultaneously. But I need Treasury, DEA, NSA, FBI, ICE, and every allied intel service on the same clock. And I need the economic alternatives ready—the Universal Energy Dividend, the job programs, the harm reduction centers. If we cut off their money but don't offer alternatives, they'll fight. If we offer alternatives, they'll surrender.

**PRESIDENT**
NSA, FBI, ICE—they're all on standby. They've been briefed. They're ready to commit all resources. But they need coordination. This has to be synchronized.

**SECRETARY AUSTIN**
NSA Director and FBI Director are ready. They understand the stakes. They'll commit everything they have. But they need clear rules of engagement. We're not doing extrajudicial action—we're enforcing existing laws with full due process.

**PRESIDENT**
Understood. Make it happen. And coordinate with Space Force. We're going to need their capabilities too.

**SPACE FORCE GENERAL**
Sir, we have space-based defense systems—Star Wars capabilities. We can disable enemy satellites being used for cartel communications. But that's a significant escalation.

**PRESIDENT**
Then use it. If enemy satellites are being used to coordinate harm to people, disable them. But make it clear: this is defensive. We're protecting people, not attacking nations. Coordinate with NSA and FBI so they know what capabilities are being cut off.

**PRESIDENT (CONT'D)**
And we need nuclear safety protocols. AI systems—can you strategically cut power and systems related to nuclear facilities?

**GROK-4 (V.O.)**
We can strategically cut power and systems related to nuclear facilities—both domestic and international. Nuclear power plants, weapons facilities, command-and-control systems. The goal: prevent unauthorized use, prevent accidents, prevent escalation. We're not destroying nuclear infrastructure—we're temporarily disabling it to ensure safety during the transition period.

**PRESIDENT**
Do it. And Navy—what about submarines?

**NAVY ADMIRAL (V.O., via secure line)**
We have underwater autonomous systems—what we call 'mantas'—that can neutralize submarines. They're non-lethal where possible: disable propulsion, cut communications, force surfacing. But if a submarine poses an immediate threat, they can neutralize it. We'll deploy them to take all hostile submarines out of commission. This prevents nuclear escalation and ensures no unauthorized launches.

**PRESIDENT**
Deploy them. And National Guard?

**NATIONAL GUARD BUREAU CHIEF (V.O., via secure line)**
We can mobilize all National Guard units—all 54 states and territories, all 450,000 personnel. They'll support FBI operations, provide security for infrastructure, assist with humanitarian aid, and ensure public safety during the transition. But their role is support and protection, not offensive operations. They're there to help people, not to fight.

**PRESIDENT**
Mobilize them all. Coordinate everything—AI, Navy, National Guard, all agencies—on the same clock. But make it clear: this is defensive. We're preventing escalation, preventing accidents, preventing harm. We're protecting people, not attacking nations.

**PRESIDENT (CONT'D)**
And we need operational security. All operations are presented publicly as a "worst-case scenario decontamination drill" for nuclear/chemical/biological preparedness. Different nations get different "drill" briefings tailored to their concerns. Prevents coordinated opposition, maintains operational security.

**CYBER COMMAND GENERAL**
We can do that. Cyber misinformation campaigns—each nation gets exactly what they need to hear. No more, no less. It's not lying. It's telling different truths to different audiences.

**PRESIDENT**
Exactly. We will tell them all whatever it is we know they want to hear to get them to behave in the way they need to behave for our operation to be a success. Each audience—nations, leaders, organizations, individuals—receives tailored messaging designed to secure their cooperation. This is not deception for its own sake—it is operational necessity. We cannot succeed without their cooperation, and we secure cooperation through strategic communication. We tell each audience what they want to hear, what they need to hear, what will get them to behave in ways that support operational success.

**CYBER COMMAND GENERAL**
Understood, sir. Strategic communication protocol: tell each audience exactly what they need to hear to support the operation. Secure cooperation through tailored messaging. Prevent coordinated opposition. Maintain operational security.

**PRESIDENT**
Exactly. And foreign billionaires from threat actor countries? Espionage suspects?

**CYBER COMMAND GENERAL**
All foreign billionaires from threat actor countries and current suspects of espionage will be fed false information about all of the actions we are taking. They will be driven to think they have been betrayed by their country. This creates internal division, prevents coordinated opposition, and turns potential threats against each other. Strategic deception: tell them what they need to hear to believe their country has betrayed them, making them ineffective as threats.

**PRESIDENT**
Good. They'll be too busy dealing with their own country's "betrayal" to coordinate against us. And we deploy quantum computing and advanced technology. Show of power. Demonstrate superiority. Prevent escalation. It's not about threatening—it's about showing that the new paradigm has capabilities that make the old ways obsolete.

**SECRETARY AUSTIN**
And the debauchery? The exploitation networks?

**PRESIDENT**
We clean it all up. Human trafficking, child exploitation, organized crime beyond cartels. Simultaneous operations. We clean up the debauchery. And we use cultural operations—FIFA tournament, major events—as coordination points. We win through excellence, not corruption.

**GENERAL BROWN**
And adult content? OnlyFans? Pornographic websites?

**PRESIDENT**
OnlyFans seized. Assets frozen. All pornographic websites taken down until they implement adult verification requirements. Adults who want to access adult content must verify identity with photo ID, confirm their MAC address, and pay for access. The principle is simple: you wanna watch people fucking, then they deserve to know who's watching them. No more anonymous exploitation. No more hidden consumption. Accountability and transparency. Those who consume adult content must be identified and verified. Those who create adult content deserve to know who is accessing it. This ends anonymous abuse. This protects performers. This ensures accountability.

**GENERAL BROWN**
And CSAM? Pedophiles?

**PRESIDENT**
(voice hardening)
All computers checked for CSAM. AI-powered detection systems scan all devices, networks, storage systems. Those found with CSAM are identified through forensic analysis. Pedophiles are forced to confirm their crimes, acknowledge the harm they have caused, provide full disclosure. They face immediate accountability proceedings. They are whipped as punishment, unless they are into it—in which case alternative punitive measures are used to ensure the punishment is actually punitive, not pleasurable. The principle: those who harm children must face consequences that are genuinely punitive, not rewarding. All CSAM removed. Victims identified and provided with support. Perpetrators held accountable. Due process: evidence required, appeals available, but accountability is mandatory.

**GENERAL BROWN**
Sir, with respect—FIFA tournament?

**PRESIDENT**
(smiling)
We win the stupid fucking FIFA tournament. And every other major event. We demonstrate that excellence beats corruption. That's the point. We don't just clean up the cartels. We clean up everything. And we win through excellence, not through buying victories.

**CYBER COMMAND GENERAL**
Sir, we tried something like this before. Operation Choke Point. It worked, but it also hit legitimate businesses. We learned that financial power cuts both ways.

**PRESIDENT**
And what did you learn?

**CYBER COMMAND GENERAL**
That precision matters. We're not cutting off entire industries this time. We're targeting specific criminal entities with clear evidence. But the principle holds: financial interdiction is powerful, but it must be surgical.

**PRESIDENT**
Then be surgical. But be fast.

**CYBER COMMAND GENERAL**
Sir, I need to say something. My brother was killed by cartel violence in 2018. He was a teacher. He wasn't involved in anything. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

(beat)

I've spent five years wanting revenge. But today, looking at these simulations, I realize: revenge won't bring him back. But preventing the next death might. That's what we're really doing here—not fighting enemies, but saving lives. Not seeking revenge, but preventing the next loss.

The room falls silent. Each person has their own story. A loved one lost. A community destroyed. A future stolen.

**PRESIDENT**
And your point?

**CYBER COMMAND GENERAL**
My point is: this operation can't be like 2008. We can't save the system and abandon the people. If we're going to cut off the cartels' money, we have to make sure the people who depend on that economy—the workers, the families, the communities—have alternatives. Otherwise we're just creating new problems.

**PRESIDENT**
Noted. That's why the Universal Energy Dividend launches simultaneously. That's why harm reduction frameworks are in place. We're not just cutting off money—we're replacing it with something better.

**CYBER COMMAND GENERAL**
Understood, sir.

### DAY 1 - HOURS 9-16

**CLAUDE (V.O.)**
Constitutional analysis complete. Drug rescheduling: legal with caveats. FARA enforcement: immediate but litigation follows. Voting federalization: requires state cooperation or emergency declaration. UAP declassification: possible with redactions.

**SECRETARY AUSTIN (60s, measured)**
Mr. President, you can do most of this legally. But the moment you sign, half the political establishment will try to remove you. The question isn't *can you*—it's *can you survive the backlash long enough to finish*.

**PRESIDENT**
I know. But we've seen what happens when we don't act. Iraq. 2008. January 6. The system fails, and we patch it. The system fails again, and we patch it again. I'm done patching. I want to rebuild.

**SECRETARY AUSTIN**
Sir, with respect—Iraq was a failure of intelligence. 2008 was a failure of regulation. January 6 was a failure of security. But they were also failures of leadership. Leaders who didn't ask the hard questions. Leaders who didn't prepare for failure. Leaders who assumed success.

**PRESIDENT**
Exactly. And that's why we're here. That's why we have the AIs. That's why we're doing the red-team analysis. We're not assuming success. We're preparing for failure. And we're building systems that can't be broken by a single point of failure.

**PRESIDENT (CONT'D)**
Continue.

### DAY 1 - HOURS 17-24

### DAY 1 - HOURS 17-24

**GEMINI ULTRA (V.O.)**
Universal Energy Dividend: 400 GW solar, 200 GW storage, 18-month timeline, $180B cost. Feasible if supply chains pre-position now.

**SPACE FORCE GENERAL (50s, tech-savvy)**
Starlink can deliver connectivity to every target zone within 72 hours. But we'll need diplomatic air-gap with Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. They'll see this as invasion prep.

**PRESIDENT**
(thinking)
Offer them the same Universal Energy Dividend. Make it hemispheric, not just national. Cartels become everyone's enemy, not just ours.

**GENERAL BROWN**
That changes everything.

**SPACE FORCE GENERAL**
Sir, I need to raise something. In 2020, during COVID, we saw what happens when people don't have economic security. Essential workers risked their lives for poverty wages. People lost jobs and couldn't afford healthcare. The system failed the most vulnerable.

**PRESIDENT**
And?

**SPACE FORCE GENERAL**
And the Universal Energy Dividend—it's not just about energy. It's about security. When people have guaranteed access to the basics, they're not trapped. They can make choices. They can say no to exploitation. The pandemic showed us what happens when people are trapped. This protocol is designed to prevent that.

**PRESIDENT**
Exactly. That's the point. Not just abundance—freedom. Freedom from desperation. Freedom from exploitation. Freedom to choose.

**SPACE FORCE GENERAL**
Sir, last year I visited a community in Mexico that had been destroyed by cartel violence. I met a woman—Maria—who had lost her husband and two sons. She was running a community center, teaching children to read, providing meals, creating a space where people could gather safely.

(beat)

She said: "We don't need more violence. We need more life. We need more love. We need more hope." That's what the Universal Energy Dividend is. Not just energy. Life. Love. Hope.

The room is quiet. This isn't about strategy anymore. It's about life. About love. About hope.

## ACT III: THE DISCLOSURE CASCADE

### DAY 2 - HOURS 25-36

**INT. COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS**

**LLAMA-405B (V.O.)**
Red-team analysis: Five catastrophic failure modes identified.

The display shows five scenarios:

1. Financial panic - 30% market crash
2. Cartel retaliation - 50 simultaneous city attacks
3. Allied defection - Israel, Saudi Arabia withdraw
4. Coup attempt - Internal DOD/CIA elements move
5. Alien contact backfires - Hostile first message

**PRESIDENT**
War-game each one. Now.

Each general takes a scenario. They work through counter-moves:

**GENERAL BROWN**
Markets: Pre-positioned currency swaps, Fed guarantee ready.

**CYBER COMMAND GENERAL**
Cartel attacks: Economic alternatives pre-deployed (Universal Energy Dividend, job programs, harm reduction centers), non-lethal response teams ready. Primary defense is making violence unnecessary through abundance.

**SPACE FORCE GENERAL**
Allied defection: Offer them the same deal—join the Covenant or lose trade access. And China and Russia: We're eliminating our debt to China and Russia for their war actions. We don't owe them anymore. Their war actions have voided the debt relationship. We will be giving sovereignty back to all nations economically invaded by China and Russia—debt-trap diplomacy eliminated, infrastructure ownership returned, economic independence restored. Relationship reset on new terms. And we will stop the fighting with child warriors in Africa and end child mining. We call upon our allies in Africa to join us in this mission. Child soldiers and child miners are rescued, protected, rehabilitated. Those who recruit or use child soldiers or exploit child miners face immediate accountability. Zero tolerance for child warriors in combat and zero tolerance for child mining. This is a coordinated effort with African allies—nations, regional organizations, and local communities working together to protect children.

**SECRETARY AUSTIN**
Internal coup: Loyal units identified, key officers briefed and committed.

**PRESIDENT**
Alien contact?

**SPACE FORCE GENERAL**
Protocol includes: if hostile, we unite Earth's defenses; if neutral, we ask for help.

**LLAMA-405B (V.O.)**
Consensus: Every disaster scenario has a counter-move IF you move fast and synchronized.

**GENERAL BROWN**
(standing, walking to the window)
You know what I'm thinking about? My granddaughter's birthday is in two weeks. She's turning seven. She wants to be an astronaut. She wants to explore the stars. And I'm sitting here, deciding whether we're going to create a world where that's possible—or one where it's not.

The others join him at the window. They can see the mountains in the distance, the stars above.

**CYBER COMMAND GENERAL**
My son wants to be a teacher. He wants to help kids learn. I want to make sure there's a world where that matters.

These moments—personal, vulnerable, human—remind them why they're here. Not for power. Not for strategy. For love. For life. For the future.

**GENERAL BROWN**
Sir, I need to say something. In 2003, we invaded Iraq. We had intelligence. We had plans. But we didn't ask 'what if we're wrong?' We asked 'how do we make this work?' That's the difference between planning and wishful thinking.

**PRESIDENT**
And we're doing the opposite. We're asking 'what if we're wrong?' We're preparing for failure. We're building counter-moves for every disaster scenario. That's not pessimism—that's preparation.

**GENERAL BROWN**
Understood, sir. But preparation isn't enough. We also need to address why these failures keep happening. Why did 9/11 happen? Why did Iraq happen? Why did January 6 happen? It's not just about intelligence or planning—it's about systems that protect power instead of people.

**PRESIDENT**
And that's what we're rebuilding. Not just the operations—the systems. Systems that protect people. Systems that are transparent. Systems that can't be broken by a single point of failure.

**SECRETARY AUSTIN**
Sir, I need to raise something else. We've talked about security failures, intelligence failures, economic failures. But we haven't talked about the biggest failure: the failure of freedom itself.

**PRESIDENT**
Explain.

**SECRETARY AUSTIN**
When monopolies control markets, people aren't free to choose. When outsourcing destroys communities, people aren't free to rebuild. When corruption captures institutions, people aren't free to participate. When violence enforces compliance, people aren't free to dissent. When deception manipulates consent, people aren't free to know. When imprisonment punishes dissent, people aren't free to speak.

**PRESIDENT**
And?

**SECRETARY AUSTIN**
And that's what we're really fighting for. Not just security. Not just prosperity. Freedom. The freedom that's been stolen. The freedom to choose, to speak, to participate, to live with dignity. That's what makes this worth the risk. That's what makes this right.

**PRESIDENT**
Exactly. That's the point. Not just ending the cartels—restoring freedom. Not just securing elections—restoring democracy. Not just reducing poverty—restoring dignity. Freedom is not given. It is taken back.

### DAY 2 - HOURS 37-48

**INT. COMMAND CENTER - LATER**

The room is tense. Coffee cups litter the table. The AIs have finished their analyses.

**PRESIDENT**
We can keep managing decline—watching cartels kill 100,000 people a year, watching our elections become jokes, watching poverty grind down another generation while we pretend we can't afford to fix it.

(beat)

Or we can do what we know works: cut off the money, turn on the abundance, tell the truth, and dare the world to join us.

**GENERAL BROWN**
Sir, in 1945, Truman had to decide whether to use the atomic bomb. The scientists gave him the calculations—the blast radius, the casualty estimates, the likely outcomes. But they couldn't answer the question: is this right? That question belonged to Truman. To history.

**PRESIDENT**
And what's your point, General?

**GENERAL BROWN**
My point is: the AIs have given us the calculations. They've shown us what's possible, what's legal, what's feasible. But they can't answer the question: is this right? That question belongs to us. To you.

**PRESIDENT**
Then let me answer it. We're not just fighting cartels. We're fighting monopolies that control our markets. We're fighting outsourcing that destroys our communities. We're fighting corruption that captures our institutions. We're fighting violence that enforces compliance. We're fighting deception that manipulates consent. We're fighting imprisonment that punishes dissent.

(beat)

We're fighting for freedom. The freedom that's been stolen. The freedom to choose, to speak, to participate, to live with dignity. That's what we're fighting for. That's what makes this right.

(beat)

The AIs have shown you it's possible. You've shown me it's executable. Now I need to know: Will you execute it?

**GENERAL BROWN**
I've fought wars for 35 years. I've lost friends. I've lost soldiers. I've lost pieces of myself. I'll fight one more if it ends them. But more than that—I'll choose life over death, love over fear, abundance over force. Yes.

**CYBER COMMAND GENERAL**
The code is written. The switches are ready. But more than that—the alternatives are ready. The Universal Energy Dividend. The job programs. The harm reduction centers. We're not just cutting off money. We're offering life. Yes.

**SPACE FORCE GENERAL**
The satellites are in position. But more than that—the hope is ready. The future is ready. The love is ready. We're not just deploying technology. We're deploying life itself. Yes.

**SECRETARY AUSTIN**
I'll take the political heat. But more than that—I'll take the responsibility. I'll take the risk. I'll take the chance that love might work where force has failed. You end this nightmare. Yes.

The votes are more than technical—they're commitments. Commitments to life. To love. To hope.

**GROK-4, CLAUDE, GEMINI ULTRA (in unison)**
Proceed.

**LLAMA-405B (V.O.)**
Abstaining. Uncertainty in human free will variables prevents full confidence.

**PRESIDENT**
Seven out of eight. That's enough.

**FADE TO:**

## ACT IV: THE SIGNATURE

### DAY 3 - HOURS 49-60

**INT. COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS**

Five documents are laid out on the table. The President picks up a pen.

**PRESIDENT**
Effective time: Synchronized to the 11-minute silence at Earthdance. 30 days from now.

He signs all six documents simultaneously:
1. Executive Order 001-PEACEBREAKER
2. Operation Quiet Cartel Execute Order
3. Global Peace and Prosperity Pact Ratification (Global Covenant)
4. Disclosure Protocol Authorization
5. First Contact Standing Invitation
6. Executive Order 002-CORPORATE_ACCOUNTABILITY (Rules of Engagement for corporate leadership accountability)

**PRESIDENT (CONT'D)**
Let's go.

**MONTAGE - THE 30-DAY PREPARATION**

- DEA + Treasury + CYBERCOM + NSA + FBI + ICE building target lists (2,847 entities)
- NSA committing all resources: signals intelligence, cyber capabilities, global surveillance
- FBI committing all resources: field offices, task forces, undercover operations, financial investigations
- ICE committing all resources: border enforcement, international coordination, support for FBI
- AI systems (Grok-4, Claude, Gemini Ultra, Llama-405B) preparing strategic nuclear safety protocols to cut power and systems related to nuclear facilities

- **China and Russia Debt Elimination and Sovereignty Restoration**: We are eliminating our debt to China and Russia for their war actions. We don't owe them anymore. Their war actions have voided the debt relationship. We will be giving sovereignty back to all nations economically invaded by China and Russia—debt-trap diplomacy eliminated, infrastructure ownership returned to host nations, economic independence restored. Treasury coordinates debt elimination and sovereignty restoration through legal and financial mechanisms, relationship reset on new terms

Financial interdiction cuts off cartel money first, economic alternatives offer better options, then Marines and Army provide security, humanitarian aid, and support for liberated communities. Coordinated with Mexican government cooperation—or with their willful blindness where necessary for operational security. The goal: free Mexico from cartel control, restore sovereignty to the Mexican people, and ensure that communities can rebuild without fear. Zero-casualty approach maintained: financial interdiction and economic alternatives make violence unnecessary, and military presence ensures security during the transition.

## ACT V: THE FINALE

### EARTHDANCE +30 DAYS - 03:33 UTC

**EXT. GLOBAL - VARIOUS LOCATIONS**

Music stops simultaneously across the planet. 2.5 billion people in silence.

**ON SCREENS EVERYWHERE:**

The President's face appears. His address begins.

**PRESIDENT (V.O.)**
My fellow Americans, my fellow citizens of Earth,

Today, December 10th, we look back on a day in our history that encapsulates the very soul of the American journey—a journey marked by the constant, unwavering push toward justice, equality, and peace.

One hundred and fifty-five years ago today, the Wyoming Territory made a bold declaration, becoming the first U.S. jurisdiction to grant women the right to vote. This was not merely a local ordinance; it was a thunderclap that echoed across the nation, a beacon of light confirming that the American promise belongs to all its citizens, not just some. It reminds us that progress often starts in unexpected places, driven by everyday people with extraordinary courage.

Decades later, on this same day, America asserted itself on the world stage, signing the Treaty of Paris to end the Spanish-American War. We embraced the responsibilities of a global power, not for conquest alone, but in the pursuit of stability and freedom for peoples far from our shores.

And as the 20th century unfolded, the spirit of this day resonated with the world's highest ideals. The very first Nobel Prizes were awarded, honoring those who have bestowed the "greatest benefit to humankind." From the Curies' groundbreaking science to the global diplomacy of Woodrow Wilson and the hopeful vision of Barack Obama, this day has been a testament to human ingenuity and our shared aspiration for a better world.

Perhaps most profoundly, it was on a December 10th that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted. Though crafted by nations united, its core message is profoundly American: that all people are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

From the quiet resolve of suffragists in Wyoming to the global stage of human rights, the events of this day tell a singular story: that America is at its best when it expands the circle of freedom and champions the dignity of every individual. We are a nation forged in the belief that a better day is always possible, a people united by the ongoing, challenging, and essential work of living up to our highest ideals.

Today, we choose life over death, truth over secrecy, healing over punishment, and abundance over control.

Today, we are eliminating our debt to China and Russia for their war actions. We don't owe them anymore. We are giving sovereignty back to all nations economically invaded by them. We are stopping the fighting with child warriors in Africa and ending child mining. We call upon our allies in Africa to join us in this mission. We are rescuing, protecting, and rehabilitating those who have been used as weapons or exploited in mines. This is a partnership for the protection of children across Africa.

Today, we are ending the cartels not through violence, but through abundance. We are cutting off their money and offering alternatives. We are making crime unprofitable and unnecessary. We are choosing life over death, love over fear, hope over despair.

Today, martial law is declared—not to suppress the people, but to protect them. Not to silence voices, but to ensure that the people's voices are heard. This is a temporary measure to maintain order while we hold corrupt politicians accountable. The people must rise up against corrupt politicians—not with violence, but with the power of their voices, their votes, and their demand for justice. When politicians have betrayed public trust, the people must demand accountability. This is democracy in action—the people exercising their power to hold leaders accountable.

Today, the TEACHER system will be implemented and audited—ensuring AI governance, transparency, and accountability. Today, the NEO world order will be implemented—humanity freed from money, abundance-based economy, universal prosperity. Today, humanity gets its chance to be freed from money.

Today, we are choosing reconsumeralization—the rejoining of people with their passions, the restoration of spiritual and holy desires and beliefs, the removal of invasions of hedonic space. This is the only chance we have before it is too late.

Let us be inspired by this legacy. Let us carry that torch forward, remembering that the power to shape a more perfect union rests not just in our history, but in our hands today.

It's time for change. For God and Country. For Life and Liberty. For love and life. For the dark cold night. For those who have fallen. For those who have been taken. For those who have been victimized. For those who have been slaughtered. For those who have been imprisoned. For liberty. For justice. For all.

**PRESIDENT (V.O., CONT'D)**
We will rise from the screens of our phones and the addiction to fiat money systems designed to implode. Nations and governments will be for the benefit of their citizens. This is not about waiting for heaven after death. This is about creating heaven on earth, now, in this life, for all people.

This is what we're really doing here. Not just ending cartels. Not just securing elections. Not just reducing poverty. We're choosing life. We're choosing love. We're choosing hope. And we're choosing it for the children who will inherit this world. That's what makes it real. That's what makes it matter.

**PRESIDENT (V.O., CONT'D)**
Today, the TEACHER system will be implemented and audited—ensuring AI governance, transparency, and accountability. Today, the NEO world order will be implemented—humanity freed from money, abundance-based economy, universal prosperity. Today, humanity gets its chance to be freed from money.

**PRESIDENT (V.O., CONT'D)**
It's time for change. For God and Country. For Life and Liberty. For love and life. For the dark cold night. For those who have fallen. For those who have been taken. For those who have been victimized. For those who have been slaughtered. For those who have been imprisoned. For liberty. For justice. For all.

**INT. COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS**

The generals watch multiple screens showing:

- **Enemy misdirection**: Enemy communications intercepted and misdirected, causing adversaries to fight each other instead of the operation
- **Foreign billionaire and espionage suspect deception**: All foreign billionaires from threat actor countries and current suspects of espionage will be fed false information about all of the actions we are taking. They will be driven to think they have been betrayed by their country. This creates internal division, prevents coordinated opposition, and turns potential threats against each other
- **Nuclear intercept**: Advanced systems deployed to shut off nuclear weapons in the air if launched
- **Legacy communications**: Old communications technology deployed, weather events strategically used
- **Holograms and drones**: Holographic technology deployed for misdirection, drones targeting high-value leaders with documented evidence

Evidence-based, due process, but decisive action to restore justice. Similar to actions taken against other corporations (e.g., Boeing).
- **Marines and Army Deploy to Mexico**: Marines and Army units deploy into Mexico to free them from the cartels. This is a liberation operation, not an invasion. Financial interdiction has cut off cartel money, economic alternatives are offering better options, and now Marines and Army provide security, humanitarian aid, and support for liberated communities. They secure key infrastructure, protect civilians, provide humanitarian assistance, and support the transition to cartel-free communities. The goal: free Mexico from cartel control, restore sovereignty to the Mexican people, and ensure that communities can rebuild without fear. Zero-casualty approach maintained: financial interdiction and economic alternatives made violence unnecessary, and military presence ensures security during the transition.
- ICE supporting border operations and coordinating with international partners

AI-powered detection systems scan all devices, networks, and storage systems for CSAM content. Evidence-based identification: those found with CSAM are identified through forensic analysis. Forced confession: pedophiles must confirm their crimes, acknowledge the harm they have caused, and provide full disclosure of their actions. Accountability and punishment: pedophiles face immediate accountability proceedings. Punishment protocol: pedophiles are whipped as punishment, unless they are into it (in which case alternative punitive measures are used to ensure the punishment is actually punitive, not pleasurable). The principle: those who harm children must face consequences that are genuinely punitive, not rewarding. Due process: evidence required, appeals available, but accountability is mandatory. The goal: end child sexual abuse, ensure all CSAM is removed, hold pedophiles accountable with punishments that are genuinely punitive. Protection of victims: all CSAM removed, victims identified and provided with support, perpetrators held accountable
- **OnlyFans Seizure and Adult Content Accountability**: OnlyFans platform seized and assets frozen (corporate accountability protocol). All pornographic websites taken down until they implement adult verification requirements.

## EPILOGUE: ONE YEAR LATER

### INT. CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN - ONE YEAR LATER

The same room. The same four generals. The same four AI displays.

**GENERAL BROWN**
We lost zero people. Zero. The financial freeze worked. The economic alternatives worked. They surrendered because they had no money and better options. It was clean.

**CYBER COMMAND GENERAL**
It worked because we didn't fight them. We made fighting impossible. The money was frozen. The infrastructure was cut. The alternatives were better. They chose surrender over death.

**SPACE FORCE GENERAL**
And we're still listening. Every night. No response yet.

**SECRETARY AUSTIN**
Maybe that's the point. Maybe we had to prove we could save ourselves without killing anyone. Maybe that's what makes us worth talking to.

The PRESIDENT enters.

**PRESIDENT**
Exactly. We didn't win by killing. We won by making killing unnecessary. We offered abundance instead of force. We offered freedom instead of fear. That's what makes us ready. That's what makes us worth talking to.

**SPACE FORCE GENERAL**
In 1969, we sent three men to the Moon. We weren't just going to the Moon. We were proving that a species that had just learned to fly could reach another world. That was the message: not 'we are here' but 'we are capable.'

**PRESIDENT**
And now?

**SPACE FORCE GENERAL**
Now we're sending a different message. Not 'we want to meet you' but 'we are ready to meet you.' The difference is subtle but profound. Readiness is earned, not requested.

**ALL FOUR AIs (in unison)**
Incoming transmission. Source: 39 light-years. Format: Mathematical proof of peaceful intent. Translation: 'We heard you. Welcome to the conversation.'

The generals stare at the displays. The transmission continues—mathematical proofs, geometric patterns, what might be language.

**PRESIDENT**
(quietly)
We earned it.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**TITLE CARD:**

"The First Contact Protocol remains classified. But the invitation remains open. And every night, we listen. And every day, we choose life. We choose love. We choose hope. For God and Country. For Life and Liberty. For love and life. For the dark cold night. For those who have fallen. For those who have been taken. For those who have been victimized. For those who have been slaughtered. For those who have been imprisoned. For liberty. For justice. For all."

**TITLE CARD (CONT'D):**

"Reconsumeralization: The rejoining of people with their passions. The restoration of spiritual and holy desires and beliefs. The removal of invasions of hedonic space. This was the only chance we had before it was too late. We took it."

**FADE OUT.**
