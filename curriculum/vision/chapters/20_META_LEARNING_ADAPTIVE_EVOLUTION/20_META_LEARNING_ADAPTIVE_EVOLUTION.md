# 20. META-LEARNING & ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION

## Purpose
A living layer that teaches how to learn, adapt, and update the framework without losing its ethics, tone, or rigor.

## Draft Outline
- Why meta-learning matters (anti-fragility, durability)
- The adaptive loop: observe â†’ model â†’ test â†’ revise â†’ deploy
- Updating the story universe (new parables/characters without breaking tone)
- Maintaining code/utilities (versioning, deprecation, change logs)
- Cognitive immunity (anti-dogma, sunk-cost checks, drift detection)
- Teaching others to teach (handoff patterns, apprenticeships)
- Meta-ethics gates (should-we before can-we)
- Human fallibility as data (postmortems, safe-to-fail experiments)
- Rituals for renewal (cadences, retros, red-team/blue-team/green-team cycles)
