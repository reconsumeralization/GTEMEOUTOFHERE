## 📊 Key Comparisons

### A-SWE vs. COSURVIVAL/SSM

| Principle | A-SWE | COSURVIVAL/SSM |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **AI Role** | Replaces workflows | Guides learning |
| **Human Agency** | Reduced | Preserved |
| **Decision Making** | AI decides | Human decides |
| **Transparency** | Unclear | Explicit |
| **Override** | Unclear | Always available |
| **Learning** | Replaced | Built |
| **Security** | Unclear governance | Governance gate required |
| **Supply Chain** | AI dependencies | Human-verified dependencies |
| **Trust** | Unclear provenance | Clear provenance + audit trails |

## 🎯 Key Insights

### 1. Advisor vs. Authority
- **A-SWE:** Replaces workflows (authority)
- **COSURVIVAL:** Guides learning (advisor)
- **Lesson:** Agency preservation requires advisor model

### 2. Security as Supply Chain Problem
- **A-SWE Risk:** AI-generated code creates new supply chain risks
- **COSURVIVAL Solution:** Governance gate + human review required
- **Lesson:** AI code must meet same trust standards as human code

### 3. Learning vs. Dependency
- **A-SWE Risk:** Skill loss (dependency)
- **COSURVIVAL Solution:** SSM preserves learning (capability building)
- **Lesson:** Long-term: capability > convenience

### 4. Trust Fabric Requirements
- **A-SWE Challenge:** Unclear code provenance, audit trails
- **COSURVIVAL Solution:** SBOM, signed artifacts, human verification
- **Lesson:** AI code requires additional governance checks

## 📚 Curriculum Connections

### Week 0: Governance Gate
- **Connection:** AI-generated code must pass governance gate
- **Lesson:** Same governance for AI and human code, plus AI-specific checks

### Week 10: Security
- **Connection:** AI-generated code security concerns
- **Lesson:** Supply chain security for AI dependencies, code provenance

### Week AI: AI Ethics
- **Connection:** AI as advisor vs. authority
- **Lesson:** A-SWE as authority (replaces), SSM as advisor (guides)

### Shadow Student Mode
- **Connection:** SSM vs. A-SWE comparison
- **Lesson:** SSM guides learning, A-SWE replaces workflows

*"AI should advise, not control. Support, not surveil. And it should be transparent about why it's recommending something — so we can trust it without becoming dependent on it."*
