# PRD: Unified Ecosystem — Reconsumeralization / TEACHER / TRIBES / COURSES / SECURITY

**Mission:** Mutually Assured Success (MAS) with human dignity, agency, privacy, spiritual respect (plural, non-coercive), advisor-not-authority AI, and absolute anti-exploitation.  
**Launch regions:** Global-first (age-appropriate, localized)  
**Primary ages:** All ages (strict age/role gating)  
**Business model hypothesis:** “One for all and all for one — shared upside, universal access, transparent value flows, anti-extractive incentives.”  
**Non-negotiable:** TEACHER supports Agent-as-Student (SSM): AI must attempt any assignment under same constraints and produce worked solution, step-by-step, common mistakes, rubric mapping, and “show me” mode.

## A) Brand & Identity
- **What is Reconsumeralization:** Ethical marketplace + trust layer + culture of transparent value exchange; paired with TEACHER (capability), TRIBES (belonging), COURSES (curriculum), SECURITY (spine).
- **What we stand for:** MAS, dignity, consent, privacy, advisor-not-authority AI, spiritual respect, anti-exploitation, transparency, shared prosperity.
- **Values:** Safety-first; Agency; Transparency; Fairness; Belonging; Stewardship; Learning-as-freedom.
- **Priorities:** 1) Child safety & anti-exploitation; 2) Security & privacy; 3) Explainability & challengeability; 4) Access & equity; 5) Utility and trust.
- **Transparency Policy:** User-readable rationale, auditable decisions, visible data uses, opt-outs, clear AI labels, “why am I seeing this?” everywhere.

## B) Consumer Side
- Consumer profile: Age/consent gated; minimal PII; roles: guest, verified, guardian-linked (for minors).
- Account preferences: Privacy/comms; notifications; export/delete.

## H) PRD Standard Sections
### Problem Statement
Adaptive capacity, trust, and safety lag AI acceleration. Education, marketplaces, and community spaces are siloed, unsafe, or extractive. We need a unified, secure, explainable ecosystem that raises the floor for all.

### Target Users & Personas
Consumers (adult/teen with guardian), guardians/families, suppliers/brands, students/learners, educators/mentors, T&S reviewers, policy/compliance partners.

### JTBD
- Choose safe, ethical products with transparency.  
- Learn/upskill safely with adaptive, explainable help.  
- Participate in trustworthy communities with protection and belonging.  
- Resolve disputes and surface truth.  
- Protect children and vulnerable users by default.

### User Journeys (condensed)
- Consumer: browse → explainable ranking → supplier profile → trust signals → purchase or report → review → dispute.
- Supplier: onboard/verify → publish catalog with provenance → respond to disputes → improve transparency scores → earn trust badges.
- Student: enroll → SSM-informed hints → assessments/credentials → tribe support → portfolio/World Grade.
- Educator: assign → see SSM rubric mapping → monitor progress → feedback → integrity checks.
- Moderator/T&S: triage queue (CSAM/abuse priority) → playbook → escalate → log.

### Competitive/Adjacent
- Marketplaces (Amazon/Etsy): scale, low transparency/bias control.
- Edtech (Coursera/Khan/LLM tutors): learning, limited safety/SSM/ethics marketplace link.
- Trust layers (Fakespot/ReviewMeta): review integrity, not integrated learning/marketplace/social.
- Differentiator: MAS + advisor-not-authority + SSM + integrated safety/ethics + transparent marketplace.

### Differentiators / Moat
- MAS + World Grade lenses (holistic, multi-lens scoring).  
- SSM (Agent-as-Student) baked into help and QA.  
- Transparency-first marketplace (provenance, disputes, explainability).  
- Trust & Safety spine (child safety, CSAM, anti-grooming).  
- Governance + challengeability; auditable algorithms.

### Feature Requirements (MVP → V1 → V2)
- **MVP (safety-first):** Governance gate; SBOM/signing; basic consumer/supplier profiles + catalog; reviews + meta-review integrity; disputes basic; TEACHER MVP + SSM pilot (worked solution, steps, mistakes, rubric, “show me”); Tribes basic with moderation; security literacy modules; explainable ranking v1; child safety (age gates, CSAM detection, reporting).  
- **V1:** Full transparency scoring; bias dashboards; World Grade surfaces; credentialing; richer assessments; advanced disputes; expanded Tribes; supplier give-back verification; richer moderation tiers; SSM coverage for core course types with educator-facing rubric mapping.  
- **V2 (vision):** Localization; partner APIs with signed attestations; advanced trust graphs; proactive safety (grooming/fraud); creator tools with built-in SSM validation.

### Out of Scope (now)
- Self-sovereign ID; crypto/on-chain payments; fully automated adjudication in high-risk cases; any spiritual authority claims.

### Risks + Mitigations
- Child exploitation: CSAM/grooming detection, age/guardian controls, human escalation, LE pathways.  
- Ranking bias: bias tests, explainability, feedback loops, audit trails.  
- Gaming/fraud: sybil resistance, velocity caps, anomaly alerts.  
- AI overreach: advisor-not-authority, SSM guardrails, reveal-mode logging, human review for high-stakes.  
- Data leaks: least privilege, redaction, minimization, strong auth.  
- Cultural insensitivity: localization review, opt-out, plural respect.

### Success Metrics
- Product: dispute SLA, supplier transparency completion, explainability usage, reduction in abuse/fraud.  
- Learning: time-to-competence, completion with integrity, SSM hint effectiveness, credential issuance with evidence.  
- Safety: CSAM/grooming blocks, abuse response SLAs, privacy incidents (target 0), bias deltas.  
- Social impact: MAS baseline uplift (safety/capability/belonging), equitable outcomes by cohort/region.

### Rollout Plan
- Phase 1: Safety & governance spine; marketplace + TEACHER MVP + SSM pilot; disputes basic.  
- Phase 2: Family pilot + Tribes; transparency scoring; SSM expansion.  
- Phase 3: Supplier expansion; give-back verification; mediation workflows; World Grade surfaces.  
- Phase 4: Institutional/NGO partners; localization; APIs.  
- Phase 5: Global MAS coalition; standards sharing.

### Governance Model
- Independent T&S board; audit and appeal.  
- Lens boundaries; challengeability.  
- Bias/impact reviews; red-team (prompt injection, fraud, CSAM).  
- **Funding Charter (TEACHER-anchored):** See `docs/FUND_CHARTER_V2.md`. Enforce TEACHER floor (50% of net funds until self-funding, then 25% perpetual), lane separation (TEACHER / Humanitarian & Child Protection / Lawful Political), supermajority + public notice for any floor change, no political influence on ranking or access, geo-risk review for political spend.  
- Decision rights: TEACHER spend approved by CTO/Head of Product + Head of Trust & Safety + CFO (Safety/Privacy veto). Political spend requires GC + Compliance + Safety and Board for thresholds; conflicts default to TEACHER/child-safety-first.  
- Transparency: Disbursements log Amount | Recipient | Lane | Justification | Expected Outcomes; annual public report and independent audits; variance >10% triggers Board review.
- Resource-Adjusted Equity: Use a Resource & Access Index (RAI) to weight funding and rollout toward high-need, low-resource regions; require appropriate TEACHER delivery tier (full / lite / offline-first / emergency) before scale; support low-bandwidth, low-compute, device-agnostic modes and local co-teaching.

### Pricing / Access
- Universal access ethos; freemium + grants/NGO sponsorship; no pay-to-win visibility; ethics-gated advanced analytics for orgs.

### Non-profit Partnerships
- Child safety, digital literacy, sustainability validation; co-own playbooks and audits.

### Accessibility & Localization
- WCAG; captions/transcripts; low-bandwidth modes; language packs; culture-aware safety; opt-in local spiritual context with strict respect boundaries.
